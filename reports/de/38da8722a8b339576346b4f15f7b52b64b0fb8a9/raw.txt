Countries other than Germany were mentioned as place of exposure 9,870 times, most frequently
Austria and Italy. Regional data were only available for some of the foreign exposure sites, so that
these figures can only be regarded as a minimum (for the most frequently named countries, Table 3).
Time course
Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 26/03/2020. In 17,651 cases, onset
of symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

alternatively by date of reporting from 20/02/2020 (27/03/2020, 12:00 AM)
Demographic distribution
Among these cases, 22,677 are male (54%) and 19,453 female (46%). In total, 307 children under the
age of 5, 846 children aged 5 to 14 years, 32,128 persons aged 15 to 59 years and 8,869 persons 60
years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 142 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 48 years.

Clinical aspects
Clinical information is available for 30,393 of the notified cases, of which 957 cases were reported as
not having any symptoms considered significant for COVID-19. The most common manifestations are
cough (16,316; 54%), fever (12,589; 41%), rhinorrhoea (7,015; 23%) and pneumonia (519; 2%).
Hospitalisation was reported in 3,245 (11%) of the 30,822 COVID-19 cases with data available.
An estimated 7,600 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases were considered to
have recovered if they had a known onset of disease on or before 12/03/2020, were not reported to
have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged and did
not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of illness onset, symptoms,
hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
The 253 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 164 men and 88
women. The median age was 82 years and the range 42 to 100 years. Of all deaths, 228 (90%) were in
persons 70 years or older (but only 10% of all cases).
Assessment by the RKI
At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe
and fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI
currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high, but as very high for
risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing
previous illnesses. The risk varies from region to region. The burden on the health care system
depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment
measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some regions. This
assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
