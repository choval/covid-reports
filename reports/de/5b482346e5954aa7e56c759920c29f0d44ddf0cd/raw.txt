With simple measures, you too can help protect yourself and others from infection, recognise symptoms
of disease and find assistance.
Protect!
Keep a distance of at least 1.5m from other people. If you cough or sneeze, it is best to turn away.
Sneeze into the crook of your arm or into a paper handkerchief that you then throw away immediately.
Avoid touching other persons when greeting them and wash your hands regularly and thoroughly
for at least 20 seconds with soap and water.
Recognise!
The initial symptoms are coughing, a runny nose, sore throat and fever. Some patients also suffer from
diarrhoea. Severe cases may experience breathing problems or develop a lung infection. Disease symptoms
can emerge up to 14 days after infection.
Act!
If any of the above-mentioned disease symptoms emerge, avoid unnecessary contact with other persons
and stay at home wherever possible. Get in touch with your doctor by phone or call 116 117 and discuss
how best to proceed, before going to his or her office. Have you had contact with someone suffering from
such a disease? Get in touch with your local health office.
