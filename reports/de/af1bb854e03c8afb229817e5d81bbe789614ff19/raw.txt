Current information
on the coronavirus
With simple measures, you too can help protect yourself and others from infection, recognise symptoms
of disease and find assistance.
Protect!
Stay as far away as possible from others when coughing or sneezing; better yet, face away from them.
Sneeze into the crook of your arm or into a paper handkerchief that you then throw away immediately.
Avoid touching other persons when greeting them and wash your hands regularly and thoroughly for
at least 20 seconds with soap and water.
Recognise!
The initial symptoms are coughing, a runny nose, sore throat and fever. Some patients also suffer from
diarrhoea. Severe cases may experience breathing problems or develop a lung infection. Disease symptoms
can emerge up to 14 days after infection.
Act!
Have you spent time in an area that has already seen cases of the novel coronavirus? If, within 14 days,
any of the above-mentioned disease symptoms emerge, avoid unnecessary contact with other persons
and stay at home wherever possible. Get in touch with your doctor by phone or call 116 117 and discuss
how best to proceed, before going to his or her office. Have you had contact with someone suffering
fromâ‰ˆsuch a disease? Get in touch with your local health office.
