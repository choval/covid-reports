WHAT HAPPENS TO
SUSPECT CASES?
Suspect cases are isolated in hospitals. Many suspect
cases turn out to have other mild diseases such as the
common flu.
Ambulance crews who ferry suspect cases to hospitals,
wear personal protective equipment, for they come
into close contact with patients and are at higher risk
of infection.
The risk of infection from transient contact is low.
There is no need to avoid places where suspected
and confirmed cases have been.
All suspect cases are reported to the Ministry of Health
promptly and transferred to hospitals via ambulances
to reduce their exposure to the general public.
