SUBJECT IN FOCUS: WHO global case-based surveillance for human infection with
coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
Following the notificationof COVID-19cases among travelersfromWuhan, China in earlyJanuary, WHOset up a global
surveillance system to gather essential information to monitor the epidemic. Beginning on 26 January, all Members
States wererequested to immediately report confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 to WHO with a minimal set
of information through a standardizedcase reporting form (CRF).
As of 13 April, a totalof 747 546 confirmed cases weredocumented via case reporting forms (CRFs) receivedfrom 113
countries, territories and areas across five different WHO regions and three international conveyances. The number
of cases with a CRF accounts for 44.0% of the confirmed cases reportedglobally as of 13April 10AM. Distribution per
regionshows that 316 076 (42.3%)of CRFs werereportedfrom the EuropeanRegion, 415484 (55.6%)from theRegion
of the Americas, 10 662(1.4%) from the Western PacificRegion, 4717 (0.6%)from the EasternMediterraneanRegion,
136 (0.02%) from the South-East Asia Region, and none from the Africa Region. An additional 471 CRFs have been
submitted from international conveyances. It is important to note that of the cases which aredocumented with CRFs
so far, the United Statesof America, Italyand Germanyaccount for 74% of all cases in the database. Thus, these data
should not be considered representativeof all globally confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Distribution by age and sex of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO case-based surveillance system
globally to date
A total of 716 570 CRFs (95.9%) reported information on age and sex. The sex ratio (male to female) among the
confirmed cases is 1.03:1, and the median ageis 51 (interquartilerange, IQR: 36-65) years. For males, themedian age
is 52 (IQR 37-65) years, and for females 50 (IQR 35-64) years. The sex ratio varies significantly with age in all ranges
except 10-19 years. The largest sex ratios (male to female) are observed amongst the 0-9 year (1.16), 60-69 year
(1.27:1), and 70-79 year (1.34:1)agegroups. Conversely, the lowest sex ratios (i.e. those showing more females than
males) arefound in the 20-29 year(0.85:1) and80 years and over (0.78:1)agegroups (Figure 2). When cases reported
from the United States, Germany and Italy are excluded, the overall sex ratio changes to 0.95:1 (more females than
males amongst the cases), while there remains an excess of males in the 0-9, 60-69 and 70-79 year agegroups (data
not shown).

systemto date.
Distribution by age of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO case-based surveillance system over time,
from 24 February through 13April, 2020
The age distribution has varied with the progression of the epidemic from 24 February (the week in which sufficient
CRFs beganto be reported) to the present. As shown in Figure 3, the proportions of cases aged0-19 years and 40-59
yearsarestable over time, whilst a steady increaseis observed in the proportion of cases aged20-39years, concurrent
with a proportional decrease in the 60-79 and 80+ years agegroups.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
§Transmission classification is based on a process ofcountry/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may
be upgraded or downgraded as new information becomes available. Not alllocations within a given country/territory/area are e qually affected;
countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category reported. Within a given
transmission category, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees oftransmission as indicated by the d iffering numbersof
cases, recency of cases,and other factors.
Terms:
- No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no confirmed cases (not shown in table)
- Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected
- Clusters of cases: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographiclocation and/or by common exposures
- Community transmission: Countries/area/territories experiencing larger outbreaks oflocal transmissiondefined through an assessmentof
factors including, but not limited to:
- Large numbers ofcases not linkableto transmissionchains
- Large numbers ofcases from sentinel lab surveillance
- Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas ofthe country/territory/area

†† As the internationalconveyance (DiamondPrincess) is no longer occupied, transmission classification cannot be applied.
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number ofnew cases may not always
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports presentofficial counts ofconfirmed
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources ofCOVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different
data cutofftimes are to be expected.

STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health careworkers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in thecontext of COVID-19 outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and
control in healthcare settings, home carefor patientswith suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and
community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with COVID-19.
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, mathematicalmodelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical careand treatment, infection
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interimguidance for countries, which are
updated regularly.
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to carefor patients with COVID-19.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reducerisk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published an updated recommendations for internationaltraffic in relation to COVID-19outbreak .
• WHO has activatedthe R&D blueprint to acceleratediagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the
response to health emergencies. COVID-19courses canbe found here and courses in additional national
languageshere. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:

• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalin anoutbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols canbe used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on thecommunity and to inform operationalmodels for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here. One
such protocol is for the investigation of earlyCOVID-19 cases and contacts(the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to
gain anearly understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof thefirst cases of
COVID-19infection detectedin any individual country, to inform thedevelopment and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce thepotential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you arenot in an area whereCOVID-19is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19is
