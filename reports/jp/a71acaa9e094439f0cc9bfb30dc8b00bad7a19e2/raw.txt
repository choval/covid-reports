Note 2 : At this moment, as a guide, clusters are defined as the place where more than 5 histories of contact by infected patients were found. Secondary infections (e.g. infection to the families) and
infection between family members are not reflected in this map. This map may not reflect the latest situation of the infection, or number of cases in each prefecture.

Outpatient facilities for Japanese Returnees
and Potential Contacts
○If a public health center decides that a patient is out of the scope of administrative testing, doctors can request
the test directly to testing institutes with their own decision.
〇For the purpose of preventing in-hospital infection and ensuring the accuracy of the testing, the test is required to
be conducted at outpatient facilities for Japanese Returnees and Potential Contacts.
○Moreover, efforts will be made to expand the number of tests to be conducted with insurance coverage, taking
into account future improvement in the preparedness of the private sectors.
