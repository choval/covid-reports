When the cumulative number of confirmed cases was on the order of 70 in
Hokkaido, it was estimated that the estimated number of patients was 941
cases (with the 95% confidence interval between 156 and 2,906), based on
information of patients among foreign visitors to Hokkaido who were later
diagnosed in their home countries. It could be therefore estimated that the
number of those infected in Hokkaido was approximately more than 10 times
as large as the reported number of infected cases. This reflects the fact that
many infected people only show extremely mild symptoms and that many
people do not seek for medical attendance (and thus not diagnosed) even
when they have symptoms.
However, it is invalid to directly apply this estimate to the entire Japan.
Moreover, approximately 700 cases in Japan are those infected on the
Diamond Princess, and so it is inappropriate to apply the obtained estimate
to those patients. Therefore, the interpretation that stated “the number of
those infected in Japan is estimated to be more than 10,000” is clearly wrong,
and such a statement is not what I gave to the media.
