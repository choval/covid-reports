Call for Proposals:
Proven vaccine technologies, applicable
for large scale manufacturing, for rapid
response against novel coronavirus,
2019-nCoV
CEPI is announcing a funding opportunity for the development of vaccine against the 2019 novel
corona virus, 2019-nCoV. This document describes the scope, requirements and processes for
submission.
This call is open for 2 weeks. The deadline for application is February 14, 15:00 CET. The call may be
extended or amended depending on programmatic need.
CEPI reviews and evaluates applications on their merits and in the context of stated eligibility
criteria and CEPI's overall project portfolio. Regardless of eligibility at any stage of a funding call,
CEPI reserves the right to consider and to decline proposals in its sole discretion.

Call for Proposals 3
1. Introduction
The rapid global spread and unique epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV virus is deeply
concerning.
In coordination with WHO, as it leads the development of a coordinated international response, CEPI is
promoting the development of new vaccines against the emerging threat of 2019-nCoV virus.
2. Objectives and the scope of this Call
The objective of this Call for Proposals is to rapidly develop and manufacture a proven vaccine
approach that can be used against the 2019-nCoV. This call aims to complement CEPI’s 2019-nCoV
portfolio and candidates should have large-scale manufacturing capabilities for 2019-nCoV. The
organization must be willing to transfer their vaccine technology to a global network of large-scale
manufacturing.
Vaccine candidates will be evaluated against several criteria to assess the utility of the product
candidate and the speed with which it can be developed and tested and induce a 2019-nCoV virus-
specific response. The technology will also be judged against its proven ability to be manufactured at
large scale.
The suggested vaccine-technology performance will be considered towards the following guidelines:
• Speed from sequence of pathogen availability to clinical-trial testing
• Number of doses needed – to gain clinical benefit
• Scale of manufacturing
o In the current situation CEPI will be aiming for a capacity of production of millions of
doses
Supporting the development of vaccines that can prevent or stop an outbreak is a key part of CEPI’s
mission. An equally critical part of the mission is to ensure that the vaccine is available and equally
accessible to those who need them. Thus, in addition to the criteria of speed and versatility the vaccine
technology must be able to be delivered to individuals easily in an outbreak setting and to be at a cost
of goods that does not preclude broad access. See CEPI’s Policies for more detail.
3. Applicant eligibility criteria
The funding opportunity through this Call is open worldwide, to all types of non-profit research
organisations, for-profit companies, international organisations and foundations, joint R&D ventures,
government research organisations, and academic institutions ideally having a geographical footprint
internationally.
Applicants must be legal entities, or consortia comprised of legal entities. At least one of the partners
in the applicant organisations or consortia of partnering organisations should have experience in
human vaccine development and have a track record of bringing vaccine candidates through to human
clinical trials in the past 10 years.
The applicant should also have a manufacturer with a track record of vaccine production identified
within the consortium.
To be eligible to submit a proposal the applicant should:
1. Hold a vaccine technology that has already been proven
a. Licensed product based on the same technology or
Call for Proposals 4
b. Relevant data from clinical trials of a vaccine candidate based on the same technology
2. Propose only one 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate per application
a. Include plans and costs for preclinical studies (toxicology / PoC / challenge /
immunotoxicology)
b. Include plans and costs to conduct Phase I studies
c. Include parallel plans and costs to generate GMP grade material for Phase II
d. Indicate final scale-up and include plans, costs, and timelines to generate final
manufacturing scale material
e. Propose how you would accelerate the pathway to licensure of your vaccine candidate
3. Have the capacity to start vaccine manufacturing in at short notice
4. Be an organization that must be willing to transfer their vaccine technology to a global network
of large-scale manufacturers and ideally has its own large-scale manufacturing capabilities
4. Applicant guidelines and the review process
The proposal must include essential evidence as required in section 3, meet the presented timeline
requirements for completion, and contain sufficient information for review of the proposed vaccine
development process. Any claims made within the proposal must be supported by evidence.
The proposal should:
• be no longer than 10 pages (excluding references)
• include high-level budget (in USD)
• be in English
This call is open for 2 weeks. The deadline for application is February 14, 15:00 CET. The review will be
done on the rolling basis therefore responses received within those days will be reviewed immediately.
The application template is accessible via CEPI website. To respond to this Call for Proposals,
entities must submit their application to CEPI via a secure portal. Please send an email
to cfp@cepi.net to be provided with a secure link to upload your application to the secure portal (in the
Subject field indicate: Application for 2019-nCoV vaccine). The application should be uploaded in a pdf
format. Do not send any additional documents. Personal data included in proposal will be handled
according to CEPI’s Privacy Notice on www.cepi.net/terms/.
This is a direct Call for proposals, which means that no additional information should be submitted, or
a preparatory meeting requested.
No costs incurred by the applicants for the development and submission of application will be
covered by CEPI. However, CEPI will consider relevant pre-award costs for successful candidates.

6. Award conditions
Before submitting an application, applicants should take note of two key award conditions. The first is
that each awardee must adhere to CEPI’s policies, which can be found on CEPI’s website. The second is
that any funding is dependent on the signing of an award agreement, which provides the terms and
conditions under which the award will be made. CEPI is committed to achieving equitable access to all
CEPI-supported programmes including vaccines, platforms, data, results, and materials. Specifically,
equitable access to epidemic vaccines in the context of an outbreak means that appropriate products
are first available to populations when and where they are needed to end an outbreak or curtail an
epidemic, regardless of ability to pay. To ensure that CEPI delivers on its commitment to equitable
access, CEPI must include access considerations as a component of any agreement with an awardee.
Applicants unable or unwilling to meet these requirements should not submit an application.
7. Technical and administrative questions
Technical and administrative questions about this Call should be directed to the CEPI Secretariat
(cfp@cepi.net).
