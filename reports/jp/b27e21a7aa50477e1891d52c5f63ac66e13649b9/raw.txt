Outpatient facilities for Japanese Returnees and
Potential Contacts
○If a public health center decides that a patient is out of the scope of administrative testing, doctors can request the test directly to
testing institutes with their own decision.
〇For the purpose of preventing in-hospital infection and ensuring the accuracy of the testing, the test is required to be conducted at
outpatient facilities for Japanese Returnees and Potential Contacts.
○Moreover, efforts will be made to expand the number of tests to be conducted with insurance coverage, taking into account
future improvement in the preparedness of the private sectors.
