Method & Results
RNA was extracted from 4 nasopharyngeal swab, 3 serum, and 1 whole blood samples
(Table 1) using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). One
hundred-µL of RNA solution was eluted from the same volume of each sample. A RNA
fragment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was amplified with One-step
RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to manufacture’s instruction. Three-µL of RNA solution
was used per reaction of 50µL. One-step RT-PCR was performed with specific primers
for spike region of 2019-nCoV; forward primer: WuhanCoV-spk1-f
5’-TTGGCAAAATTCAAGACTCACTTT-3’ and reverse/RT primer:
WuhanCoV-spk2-r 5’-TGTGGTTCATAAAAATTCCTTTGTG-3’ amplifying
24370-24916nt in GenBank MN908947 (547bp). RT-PCR was performed in ABI9700
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under the following condition: 50°C 30min,
95°C 15min; 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min. PCR
products were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis staining ethidium bromide.
The results are shown in Figure 1. Single band of 547bp was detected in the sample
No.2. The amplicon was purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen)
following manufacture’s instruction. Direct sequencing analysis was performed with
Big-dye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit and ABI 3130 sequencer (Applied
Biosystems and Fasmac, Tokyo, Japan). The 498bp of analyzed sequence excluded PCR
primers showed 100% match with the sequence of 2019-nCoV (WH-human1,
24394-24891nt in GenBank MN908947, Figure 2).

Five-µL of PCR product was loaded in each lane. The predicted size of PCR amplicon
(547bp) is indicated.
Figure 2 Sequence alignment of the PCR product with 2019-nCoV. The 498bp of
analyzed sequence excluded PCR primers (the lower sequence) is aligned with
24394-24891nt in GenBank MN908947 (WH-Human-1-GenBank, the upper sequence).
