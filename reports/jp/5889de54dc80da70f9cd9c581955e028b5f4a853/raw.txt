by the Government of Japan
(summary)
March 28, 2020
The Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare reported to the Prime Minister
that there is a high risk of coronavirus spreading widely, and therefore the
Government established the Task Force based on the Act on Special Measures
against Pandemic Influenza.
In order to protect the lives of the people, it is important to reduce the
number of infected people, particularly the elderly, and to maintain medical
systems and social functions.
Although there are currently no areas where large scale spread of the virus
has been identified, containment of patients with unknown routes of
transmission or clusters is important to prevent an explosion of cases and
minimize the number of infected patients, severe cases, and death as much
as possible.
This Basic Policies present measures to be taken so that the government,
local governments, and the people will work together to have an accurate
grasp of the situation and further advance countermeasures against the novel
coronavirus infectious disease.
1. Facts on current situation of the novel coronavirus infectious disease
In Japan, increase in the number of patients with no apparent routes of
transmission are reported sporadically in several regions. While the domestic
situation is continuing to hold, it could move toward a pandemic with an
explosive spread of infections.
Looking at overseas, the novel coronavirus infection has been identified in
all the continent, except for the Antarctica, with some areas with an explosive
spread of infections. There are some patients who are presumed to come back
to Japan after infected overseas.
