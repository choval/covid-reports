About the new coronavirus
and the disease COVID-19
Since December 2019, a new coronavirus is
spreading globally. COVID-19 is the disease
caused by the new virus.
Most people experience mild illness
Most people experience mild symptoms such as cough
and fever that will disappear on their own, but some
people develop more severe illness with breathing diffi-
culty and pneumonia.
The virus spreads through close contact with an infected
person or through respiratory droplets when an infected
person coughs or sneezes.
The symptoms are often mild and usually they develop
about five days after exposure to the virus, but symptoms
may appear earlier or later than five days.
COVID-19 causes a general feeling of illness
with one or more of the following
symptoms:
• cough
• fever
• shortness of breath
• runny nose
• sore throat
• headache
• aching muscles or joints
• nausea.
Older people may develop more severe
illness
Some people develop more severe symptoms, such as
difficulty breathing and pneumonia.
Most of those who develop severe illness are people
older than 80 years of age. People with chronic heart or
lung disease and people who have cancer are at higher
risk of developing severe illness.
