Taking off personal
protective equipment (PPE)
for non-aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)*
• 
PPE should be removed in an
order that minimises the risk of
self-contamination
• 
Gloves, aprons (and eye protection if used)
should be taken off in the patient’s room
or cohort area
Remove gloves. Grasp the
outside of glove with the
opposite gloved hand; peel off.
Hold the removed glove in the
remaining gloved hand.
Remove facemask once your clinical work is completed. Clean hands with
soap and water.
Untie or break bottom ties, followed by top ties or elastic,
and remove by handling the ties only. Lean forward slightly.
Discard. DO NOT reuse once removed.
Slide the fingers of the
un-gloved hand under the
remaining glove at the wrist.
Peel the remaining glove off
over the first glove and discard.
