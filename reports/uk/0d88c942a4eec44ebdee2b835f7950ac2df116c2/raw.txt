Dear Chris and Simon,
Re: COVID-19 â€“ MINISTERIAL DIRECTION
Thank you for your letter of 28th March 2020.
I want to put on record my gratitude for the immense efforts of staff across the NHS, the
care system and in the Department in tackling the spread and impact of coronavirus.
I recognise, as part of this, the work you and your teams have been doing with colleagues
in the Treasury to ensure that availability of funding is not a barrier or delay to the actions
we need to take. On that basis, and recognising the extraordinary circumstances this
country is facing, I am content to direct you to continue in this way, even where this means
spending in excess of formal Departmental Expenditure Limits.
I am copying this letter to recipients of yours.
Yours ever,
MATT HANCOCK
