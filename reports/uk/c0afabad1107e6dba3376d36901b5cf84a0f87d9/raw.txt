To all GP Practices in England whose IT systems are supplied by TPP or EMIS
Notice under Regulation 3(4) of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information)
Regulations 2002 (COPI), which were made under sections 60 (now section 251 of the
NHS Act 2006) and 64 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001.
The health and social care system is taking extensive action to manage and mitigate the
spread and impact of the current outbreak of COVID-19. Today, I am writing to GP practices
in England, whose IT systems are supplied by The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) or Egton
Medical Information Systems (EMIS), under Regulation 3(4) of COPI to require them to
release primary care patient data, in respect of UK Biobank’s consented participants only, to
UK Biobank, for the purposes set out in Regulation 3(1) of COPI.
This notice requires all GP practices, whose IT systems are supplied by TPP or EMIS, to
instruct them to release the relevant primary care data to UK Biobank for purposes related to
the outbreak of COVID-19.
This Notice will be reviewed on or before 30 September 2020 and may be extended by me by
further notice in writing for the period specified in that notice. If no further notice is sent to you
by me, this Notice will expire on 30 September 2020.
Purposes related to the outbreak of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following:
• understanding Covid-19 and risks to public health, trends in Covid-19 and such risks, and
controlling and preventing the spread of Covid-19 and such risks;
• identifying and understanding information about patients or potential patients with or at
risk of Covid-19, information about incidents of patient exposure to Covid-19 and the
management of patients with or at risk of Covid-19 including: locating, contacting,
screening, flagging and monitoring such patients and collecting information about and
providing services in relation to testing, diagnosis, self-isolation, fitness to work,
treatment, medical and social interventions and recovery from Covid-19;
• understanding information about patient access to health services and adult social care
services and the need for wider care of patients and vulnerable groups as a direct or
indirect result of Covid-19 and the availability and capacity of those services or that care;
• monitoring and managing the response to Covid-19 by health and social care bodies and
the Government including providing information to the public about Covid-19 and its
effectiveness and information about capacity, medicines, equipment, supplies, services
and the workforce within the health services and adult social care services;
• delivering services and information to patients, clinicians, the health services and adult
social care services workforce and the public about and in connection with Covid-19,
including the provision of information, fit notes and the provision of health care and adult
social care services; and
• research and planning in relation to Covid-19.
A record should be kept of all data processed under this notice.
Why are we doing this
UK Biobank has explicit consent from all its c.500,000 participants to be provided with, hold
and process their health care records (both primary and secondary).
UK Biobank has secured frequent feeds from Public Health England for the confirmed COVID-
19 cases and these data will be incorporated into the main UK Biobank database for
researchers to study determinants of COVID-19 infection. However, as the COVID-19
situation worsens it is likely that many presumed cases will not be tested (especially among
the elderly) and many individuals will remain at home (even when their symptoms are severe).
Consequently, the ability of UK Biobank to be able also to incorporate primary care data into
its resource is likely to be of enormous value to obtain a more complete assessment of the
determinants of COVID-19 outcomes. This is something that we need to do now.
Key points
• The validity of UK Biobank’s participant consent for this purpose has been reviewed and
endorsed by the Information Commissioner’s Office;
• Only primary care data from UK Biobank’s consented participants will be extracted;
• The proposed extraction is fully consistent with the provisions of the GDPR;
• UK Biobank only release de-identified data to its approved researchers (for the conduct of
health-related research, relating to COVID-19 in this case, which is in the public interest)
and so patient confidentiality is maintained;
• The extraction will relate to the primary care coded data, including data on diagnoses
(important for co-morbidities), on prescriptions (important for drug interactions) and on
investigations (for pathology reports);
• Following the instruction provided above, there is no further action that any GP practice
needs to undertake; and
• This Notice is limited to those GP practices whose IT systems are supplied by TPP or EMIS
because UK Biobank has appropriate agreements in place with these companies.
Yours sincerely,
On behalf of
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
