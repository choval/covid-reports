Directions 2020
The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care gives the following Directions in exercise of the
powers conferred by sections 253 and 272(7) of the National Health Service Act 2006(a).
The Secretary of State considers that the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in England constitutes an emergency for the purposes of section
253(1) of that Act and that, during the emergency, the network and information systems held by or
on behalf of the NHS in England or those bodies which provision public health services in
England must be protected to ensure those systems continue to function to support the provision of

Accordingly, the Secretary of State considers that it is appropriate to give these Directions.
