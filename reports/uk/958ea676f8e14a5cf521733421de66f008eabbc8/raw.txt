1. Introduction

1. Introduction
The following advice is provided as a resource for UK healthcare professionals based on a combination of
available evidence, good practice and expert advice.The priorities are:
(i) The reduction of transmission of COVID-19 to pregnant women.
(ii) The provision of safe care to pregnant women with suspected/confirmed COVID-19.
Please be aware that this is very much an evolving situation and this guidance is a living document that is being
updated as new information becomes available.We therefore suggest that you visit this page regularly for
current advice.
On 20th March 2020, the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) launched a registry for all women
admitted to UK hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. Further information can be found
here.
This guidance will be kept under regular review as new evidence emerges. If you would like to suggest
additional areas for this guidance to cover, any clarifications required or to submit new evidence for
consideration, please email COVID-19@rcog.org.uk. Please note, we will not be able to give individual clinical
advice or information for specific organisational requirements via this email address.
1.1 The virus
Novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus causing COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan
City, China. Other human coronavirus (HCoV) infections include HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, which
usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).
1.2 Epidemiology
The virus appears to have originated in Hubei province in China towards the end of 2019.Within Europe, Italy
is the country currently most affected.The WHO coronavirus dashboard has country by country information.
WHO also published a daily international situation report.The total number of confirmed cases in the UK is
published by the Department of Health and Social Care, and is available in a visual dashboard.
6
This situation, however, is changing rapidly and for the most up-to-date advice please consult national health
protection advice. Health protection is a devolved matter and links to national guidance are available for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Public Health England (PHE) and Health Protection Scotland
(HPS) have been cited throughout this document; specific guidance from the other areas of the UK will be
updated as they become available. At the time of writing, Public Health Wales are aligning with PHE on case
definitions, assessment, infection prevention and control and testing. We will update this guidance if this
changes.
1.3 Transmission
Most cases of COVID-19 globally have evidence of human to human transmission.This virus can be readily
isolated from respiratory secretions, faeces and fomites.There are two routes by which COVID-19 can be
spread: directly from close contact with an infected person (within 2 metres) where respiratory secretions
can enter the eyes, mouth, nose or airways.This risk increases the longer someone has close contact with
an infected person who has symptoms; and secondly indirectly by touching a surface, object or the hand of
an infected person that has been contaminated with respiratory secretions and then touching own mouth,
nose, or eyes. Healthcare providers are recommended to employ strict infection prevention and control (IPC)
measures; as per local Health Protection guidance.
Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy
itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally cause
more severe symptoms and this will be the same for COVID-19.
With regard to vertical transmission (transmission from mother to baby antenatally or intrapartum), emerging
evidence now suggests that vertical transmission is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected
and the significance to the neonate has yet to be determined.Two reports have published evidence of IgM for
SARS-COV-2 in neonatal serum at birth.1,2
Since IgM does not cross the placenta, this is likely to represent a
neonatal immune response to in utero infection. Previous case reports from China suggested that there was
no evidence for this and amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and
breastmilk samples from COVID-19 infected mothers have so far all tested negative for the virus.3-6
The evidence above is all based on small numbers of cases.The situation may change and we will continue to
monitor outcomes. MBRRACE-UK have just started centralised, real-time monitoring of affected mothers and
their babies through UKOSS, the data from which we will include in future versions of this guideline.
1.4 Effect on the pregnant woman
There is evolving evidence within the general population that there could be a cohort of asymptomatic
individuals or those with very minor symptoms that are carrying the virus, although the incidence is unknown.
Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold/flu like symptoms. Cough, fever and shortness of
breath are other relevant symptoms.
It has long been known that, whilst pregnant women are not necessarily more susceptible to viral illness,
changes to their immune system in pregnancy can be associated with more severe symptoms. This is
particularly true towards the end of pregnancy. More severe symptoms such as pneumonia and marked
hypoxia are widely described with COVID-19 in older people, the immunosuppressed and those with long-
term conditions such as diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.7
These same symptoms could occur in
pregnant women so should be identified and treated promptly.The absolute risks are, however, small.
At present there is one published case of a woman with severe COVID-19 who was admitted to hospital at
34 weeks’ gestation, had an emergency caesarean birth for a stillborn baby and was admitted to the intensive
care unit with multiple organ dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation.8
A recently published statement by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research
Centre in the UK reported, of the first 775 patients admitted to critical care settings with a diagnosis of
COVID-19, one was pregnant and four recently pregnant (within the last six weeks).9
Other reported cases of
COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy are milder and with good recovery.10
Individual responses to viral infection are different for different women and for different viruses. However,
influenza and pregnancy provides a useful comparator: data from Australia have identified that there are
significant increases in critical illness in later pregnancy, compared with early pregnancy.11
In other types of
coronavirus infection (SARS, MERS), the risks to the pregnant woman appear to increase in particular during
the last trimester of pregnancy. In at least one study, there was an increased risk of preterm birth being
indicated for maternal medical reasons after 28 weeks’ gestation.12
1.5 Effect on the fetus
There are currently no data suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to
COVID-19. Case reports from early pregnancy studies with SARS and MERS do not demonstrate a convincing
relationship between infection and increased risk of miscarriage or second trimester loss.13
7
There is no evidence currently that the virus is teratogenic.Very recent evidence has, however, suggested that it
is probable that the virus can be vertically transmitted, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the
significance to the neonate has yet to be determined.1,2
There are case reports of preterm birth in women with COVID-19, but it is unclear whether this was always
iatrogenic, or whether some were spontaneous. Iatrogenic birth was predominantly for maternal indications
related to the viral infection, although there was evidence of fetal compromise and prelabour preterm rupture
of the membranes in at least one report.3

2. Advice for health
professionals
to share with
pregnant women

2. 
Advice for health professionals to share with
pregnant women
2.1 General advice
As a pregnant woman the news that you were placed in a ‘vulnerable group’ by the UK Government on
Monday 16 March 2020 may have caused you concern.
The evidence to date is that pregnant women are still no more likely to contract the infection than the general
population.What is known is that pregnancy, in a small proportion of women, can alter the body’s response to
severe viral infections.This is something that midwives and obstetricians have known for many years and are
used to dealing with.
What has driven the decisions made by officials is the need to restrict spread of illness because if the number
of infections were to rise sharply, the number of severely infected pregnant women could rise and this could
put them in danger.
Our general advice is that:
•	
If you are infected with COVID-19 you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from
which you will make a full recovery.
•	
If you develop more severe symptoms or your recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that you are
developing a more significant chest infection that requires enhanced care, and our advice remains
that if you feel your symptoms are worsening or if you are not getting better you are recommended
to contact the NHS on 111 (or a local alternative), or your maternity unit, straight away for further
information and advice.
2.2 Advice regarding social distancing and self-isolation
The UK Government has decided that, given the limited information currently available about how COVID-19
could affect pregnancy, it would be prudent for pregnant women to stringently engage with social distancing
measures to reduce the risk of infection.
All pregnant women, regardless of gestation, should observe the social distancing guidance available on the
Government website.Advice includes the avoidance of contact with people who are known to have COVID-19
or those who exhibit possible symptoms:
• For all vulnerable people including pregnant women14
• For individuals and households of individuals with symptoms of new continuous cough or fever15
Women above 28 weeks’ gestation are recommended to be particularly attentive to social distancing and
minimising contact with others.
Major new measures have been announced for people at highest risk from coronavirus.This includes pregnant
women with significant heart disease (congenital or acquired).16
Specific recommendations regarding going to work have been published separately on the RCOG website.
2.3 Advice regarding your appointments or urgent visits to clinics and hospitals
If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies, the following
practical advice may be helpful:
•	
If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, please contact your maternity unit for advice
and to agree a plan.You may still be advised to attend for a visit but the appointment may change due
to staffing requirements.
• If you are between appointments, please wait to hear from your maternity team.
If you are attending more regularly in pregnancy, then your maternity team will be in touch with plans for
further appointments, as required.
Whatever your personal situation please consider the following:
•	
Maternity care is essential, and has been developed over many years to reduce complications in
mothers and babies.The risks of not attending antenatal care include harm to you, your baby or both
of you, even in the context of coronavirus. It is important that you keep in contact with your maternity
team and continue to attend your scheduled routine care when you are well.
11
•	
If you have any concerns, please contact your maternity team as usual but please note they may take
longer than usual to get back to you.
•	
If you have an urgent problem related to your pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, get in touch
using the same emergency contact details you already have. Please do not contact this number unless
you have an urgent problem.
•	
If you have symptoms of COVID-19, please contact your maternity team and they will arrange the right
place and time to come for your visits.You should not attend a routine clinic.
•	
You will be asked to come alone to clinical appointments, or keep the number of people with you to
one (including midwifery visits in your home).
•	
There may be a need to reduce the number of antenatal visits you have.This will be communicated
with you, and will be done as safely as possible, taking into account available evidence on the safe
number of visits required. Please do not reduce your number of visits without agreeing so first with
your maternity team.
At this time, it is particularly important that you help your maternity team take care of you. If you have had an
appointment cancelled or delayed, and are not sure of your next contact with your maternity team, please let
them know by using the contact numbers provided to you at booking.

3. Advice for all
midwifery and
obstetric services
caring for pregnant
women
3. 
Advice for all midwifery and obstetric services
caring for pregnant women
3.1 
General advice regarding the continued provision of antenatal and
postnatal services
The situation is currently moving very fast and reconfiguration of services is likely to be necessary. At present,
the following is recommended:
•	
Antenatal and postnatal care is based on years of evidence to keep mothers and babies safe in
pregnancy and birth. The majority of antenatal and postnatal care should therefore be regarded as
essential care and women should be encouraged to attend, despite being advised to otherwise engage
with social distancing measures.
•	
Women should be advised to attend routine antenatal care unless they meet current self-isolation
guidance for individuals and households of individuals with symptoms of new continuous cough
or fever.15
Maternity care has been shown repeatedly to be essential, and studies in the UK and
internationally have shown that if women do not attend antenatal services they are at increased risk of
maternal death, stillbirth, and other adverse perinatal outcomes.17,18
•	
Units should rapidly seek to adopt teleconferencing and videoconferencing capability and consider
what appointments can be conducted remotely. We hope to issue further guidance on this soon.
The NHS has provided guidance on the relaxation of information governance requirements for video
calling.
• Recordkeeping remains paramount.
•	
Electronic record systems should be used and, where remote access for staff or patients is an available
function, this should be expedited. When seeing women face-to- face, simultaneous electronic
documentation will facilitate future remote consultation.
•	
Units should appoint a group of clinicians to coordinate care for women forced to miss appointments
due to self-isolation. Women should be able to notify the unit of their self-isolation through telephone
numbers that are already available to them. Appointments should then be reviewed for urgency and
either converted to remote appointments, attendance appropriately advised or deferred.
14
o 
For women who have had symptoms, appointments can be deferred until 7 days after the start of
symptoms, unless symptoms (aside from persistent cough) persevere.
o	
For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of
COVID-19, appointments should be deferred for 14 days.
•	
Units should have a system to flag women who have missed serial appointments, which is a particular
risk for women with small children who may become repeatedly unwell.Any woman who has a routine
appointment delayed for more than 3 weeks should be contacted.
•	
Pregnant women will continue to need at least as much support, advice, care and guidance in relation
to pregnancy, childbirth and early parenthood as before the pandemic.
•	
It is important that care is available to ensure continued support for women with multiple complex
needs.Women living with adversity including poverty, homelessness, substance misuse, being an asylum
seeker, experiencing domestic abuse and mental health problems will continue to require timely expert
support.
•	
Isolation, bereavement, financial difficulties, insecurity and inability to access support systems are all
widely recognised risk factors for mental ill-health.The coronavirus epidemic increases the risk of
perinatal anxiety and depression, as well as domestic violence.19
It is critically important that support
for women and families is strengthened as far as possible; that women are asked about mental health at
every contact; and that women are urged to access support through remote means as far as possible.
• Individualised plans for women requiring frequent review may be necessary.
3.2 General advice regarding possible service modifications during COVID-19
Service modifications may be indicated to assist women with practicing recommended social distancing
measures, to reduce the risk of transmission between women, staff and other clinic/hospital visitors and to
provide care to women who are self-isolating for suspected/confirmed COVID-19.
Units should identify areas where there are clear possibilities for rationalisation of services.
Particular possibilities include reducing induction of labour for indications that are not strictly necessary. For
example, for reduced fetal movements or before 41 weeks in healthy low risk women.20,21
Consideration should
15
also be given to routine growth scans where this is not for a strict guidance-based indication. It may be possible
to improve outpatient provision of induction of labour, depending on availability of transport to hospital.
We are developing, together with a wide range of co-authors, a series of guidance documents to assist
maternity units with changes to services that they provide, which may occur during the COVID-19 pandemic.
These are available on the RCOG website and include:
• Guidance for early pregnancy services
• Guidance for antenatal and postnatal services
• Guidance for antenatal screening (including screening ultrasound)
• Guidance for fetal medicine services
• Guidance for maternal medicine clinics
•	
Guidance for self-monitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy (for women with hypertensive disorders
of pregnancy)
3.3 General advice regarding intrapartum services
•	
Intrapartum services should be provided in a way that is safe, with reference to minimum staffing
requirements and the ability to provide emergency obstetric, anaesthetic and neonatal care where
needed.
•	
Women should be permitted and encouraged to have a birth partner present with them in their
labour and during birth.A single, asymptomatic birth partner should be permitted to stay with the
woman, at a minimum, through labour and birth, unless the birth occurs under general anaesthetic.
Having a trusted birth partner present throughout labour is known to make a significant difference to
the safety and well-being of women in childbirth.22-24
o 
On attendance to the maternity unit, all birth partners should be asked whether they have had
any symptoms which could suggest COVID-19 in the preceding seven days. If the onset of these
symptoms was seven days or less ago, or they still have symptoms (other than persistent cough),
they should be asked to leave the maternity unit immediately and self-isolate at home.
16
o	 
The symptoms to ask about are: fever, acute persistent cough, hoarseness, nasal discharge/congestion,
shortness of breath, sore throat, wheezing or sneezing.
o	 
Birth partners who are not symptomatic of COVID-19 may be asked to remain by the woman’s
bedside, not walk around the ward/hospital and should be given clear advance guidance on what
is expected of them if they accompany the woman to the operating theatre (e.g. for Caesarean
section).This is particularly important given the known challenges of staff communication when
wearing full PPE.
• 
Restrictions on other visitors, such as limiting the number of birth partners to one, restricting any or
all visitors to antenatal or postnatal wards (to ensure compliance with social distancing measures), and
preventing swapping and postnatal visitors, should follow hospital policy.
•	
The evidence for the safety of birth settings that are not co-located with an obstetric unit is based on
the availability of ambulance services to enable rapid transfer, and appropriate staffing levels.25
If these
are not in place, it may be reasonable to rationalise the provision of these services.
3.4 Smoking cessation and carbon monoxide monitoring in pregnancy
Smoking is very likely to be associated with worse outcomes for COVID-19, although presently available
research cannot accurately estimate the effect. It is therefore particularly important to emphasise the need to
stop smoking as soon as possible to all women.26
The National Centre for Smoking Cessation andTraining (NCSCT) has recommended the suspension of
monitoring carbon monoxide during pregnancy, as a precautionary measuring following concern about the risk
of coronavirus transmission. Other aspects of care targeted to identify smokers and assist with cessation should
still continue. Further guidance is available.
17
3.5 Maternal mental wellbeing
This pandemic will inevitably result in an increased amount of anxiety in the general population, and this is likely
to be even more so for pregnant women as it represents an additional period of uncertainty. Specifically, these
anxieties are likely to revolve around:
• COVID-19 itself.
• The impact of social isolation resulting in reduced support from wider family and friends.
• The potential of reduced household finances.
•	
Major changes in ante-natal and other NHS care with appointments being changed from face-to-face
to telephone contact.
The change in appointment style will also make assessment for women experiencing domestic violence, women
with safeguarding concerns and women who are misusing substances more difficult.
A general increase in anxiety is to be expected in the current situation. Often simply acknowledging these
difficulties can help to contain some of these anxieties.This can be facilitated by maintaining access to midwifery
services, accessing sources of self-help for anxiety and stress, and when necessary self-referral to local IAPT
(Improving Access to PsychologicalTherapies) services in England or equivalents in other nations.
Further information is available from the RCPsych website.

4. Advice for
services caring
for women
with suspected
or confirmed
COVID-19
4. 
Advice for services caring for women with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19
The following advice refers mostly to the care of women in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy.
Care of women in the first trimester should include attention to the same infection prevention and
investigation/diagnostic guidance.
Specific advice regarding the acute care of pregnant women admitted with moderate or severe symptoms of
COVID-19 can be found in section 4.7.1.
4.1 
General advice for services providing care to pregnant women
The following suggestions apply to all hospital/clinic attendances for women with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19:
•	
Women should be advised to attend via private transport where possible or call 111/999 for advice as
appropriate.
•	
If an ambulance is required, the woman should alert the call handler that she is currently in self-isolation
for possible or confirmed COVID-19.
•	
Women should be asked to alert a member of maternity staff to their attendance when on the
hospital premises, by telephone prior to entering the hospital.
•	
Staff providing care should take personal protective equipment (PPE) precautions as per local health
protection guidance.27
•	
Women should be met at the maternity unit entrance by staff wearing appropriate PPE and be
provided with a surgical face mask (not a filtering face piece level 3 (FFP3) mask).The face mask should
not be removed until the woman is isolated in a suitable room.
•	
Women should immediately be escorted to an isolation room or cohort bay/ward, suitable for the
majority of care during their hospital visit or stay.
20
o	 
Isolation rooms or ward bays should ideally have a defined area for staff to put on and remove
PPE, and ensuite bathroom facilities.
o Further advice on care in isolation rooms versus COVID-19 cohort bays is available from PHE.
• Only essential staff should enter the room and visitors should be kept to a minimum.
• Remove non-essential items from the clinic/scan room prior to the woman arriving there.
• All clinical areas used will need to be cleaned after use as per health protection guidance.27
4.2 
Women presenting for care with unconfirmed COVID-19 but symptoms
suggestive of possible infection
Maternity departments with direct entry for patients and the public should have a system in place for identifying
potential cases as soon as possible, to prevent potential transmission to other patients and staff.This should
be at first point of contact (either near the entrance or at reception) to ensure early recognition and infection
control.This should be employed before a patient takes a seat in the maternity waiting area.
Services should follow guidance available from the NHS about whether the woman is at risk of COVID-19. If a
woman meets PHE criteria for COVID-19 testing, she should be tested. Current criteria (correct at the time of
publishing this update) is:
Women who are being/are admitted to hospital with one of the following:
• Clinical/radiological evidence of pneumonia.
• Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
•	Fever ≥37.8 AND at least one of acute persistent cough, hoarseness, nasal discharge/congestion,
shortness of breath, sore throat, wheezing or sneezing.
Furthermore, we recommend that women with an isolated fever should be investigated and treated according
to the unit protocol.This will include sending a full blood count. If lymphopenia is identified on the full blood
count, testing for COVID-19 should be arranged.
21
Until test results are available, the woman should be treated as though she has confirmed COVID-19.The full
Public Health England guidance has been summarised in a flowchart for this guideline (Appendix 1).28
Women may attend hospital for reasons directly related to pregnancy and also have coincidental symptoms
meeting the COVID-19 case definition. In cases of uncertainty, seek additional advice or in case of emergency,
investigate and treat as suspected COVID-19 until advice can be sought. Suspected COVID-19 should not
delay administration of therapy that would be usually given (for example, IV antibiotics in woman with fever and
prolonged rupture of membranes).
In the event of a pregnant woman attending with an obstetric emergency and being suspected or confirmed
to have COVID-19, maternity staff must first follow IPC guidance.This includes transferring the woman to an
isolation room and donning appropriate PPE.This can be time consuming and stressful for patients and health
professionals. Once IPC measures are in place, the obstetric emergency should be dealt with as the priority. Do
not delay obstetric management in order to test for COVID-19.
Further care, in all cases, should continue as for a woman with confirmed COVID-19, until a negative test result
is obtained.
4.3 
Attendance for routine antenatal care in women with current suspected or
confirmed COVID-19
Routine appointments for women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (growth scans, oral glucose
tolerance test, antenatal community or secondary care appointments) should be delayed until after the
recommended period of self-isolation. Advice to attend more urgent pre-arranged appointments (fetal
medicine surveillance, high risk maternal secondary care) will require a senior decision on urgency and potential
risks/benefits.
Trusts/boards are advised to arrange local, robust communication pathways for senior maternity staff members
to screen and coordinate appointments missed due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
If it is deemed that obstetric or midwifery care cannot be delayed until after the recommended period of
isolation, infection prevention and control measures should be arranged locally to facilitate care. Pregnant
women in self-isolation who need to attend should be contacted by a local care coordinator to re-book urgent
appointments / scans, preferably at the end of the working day.
If ultrasound equipment is used, this should be decontaminated after use in line with national guidance.
22
4.4 
Attendance for unscheduled/urgent antenatal care in women with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19
When possible, early pregnancy units (EPUs) or maternity triage units should provide advice over the
telephone. If this requires discussion with a senior member of staff who is not immediately available, a return
call should be arranged.
Local protocols are required to ensure women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are isolated on arrival
to EPUs or maternity triage units and full PPE measures are in place for staff (see Section 4.1).
Medical, midwifery or obstetric care should otherwise be provided as per routine.
4.5 
Women who develop new symptoms of COVID-19 during admission
(antenatal, intrapartum or postnatal)
There is an estimated incubation period of 0-14 days (mean 5-6 days); an infected woman may therefore
present asymptomatically, developing symptoms later during an admission.29
Health professionals should be aware of this possibility, particularly those who regularly measure patient vital
signs (e.g. healthcare assistants). In the event of new onset of respiratory symptoms with/without unexplained
fever , which meet the PHE case-definition for suspected COVID-19 (section 4.2), the woman should be
isolated and appropriate infection control precautions initiated in line with UK Infection Prevention and
Control Guidance.The local Infection Prevention and Control team should also be notified.
Furthermore, we recommend that women with an isolated fever should be investigated and treated according
to the unit’s protocol.This will include sending a full blood count. If lymphopenia is identified on the full
blood count, or the woman has other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, testing for COVID-19 should be
considered.
It is recognised that this may lead to substantial numbers of women treated as suspected COVID-19.
Suspected COVID-19 should not delay administration of therapy that would be usually given (for example, IV
antibiotics in woman with fever and prolonged rupture of membranes).
Recommended care for women who have moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19 during pregnancy is
covered in section 4.7.1.
23
4.6 
Women attending for intrapartum care with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19
4.6.1 Attendance in labour
All women should be encouraged to call the maternity unit for advice in early labour.Women with mild
COVID-19 symptoms can be encouraged to remain at home (self-isolating) in early (latent phase) labour as
per standard practice.
If homebirth or birth in a midwifery-led unit is planned, a discussion should be initiated with the woman
regarding the potentially increased risk of fetal compromise if infected with COVID-19.3
The woman should be
advised to attend an obstetric unit for birth, where the baby can be monitored using continuous electronic fetal
monitoring (EFM).This guidance may change as more evidence becomes available.
When a woman decides to attend the maternity unit, general recommendations about hospital attendance
apply (see section 4.1).
Once settled in an isolation room, a full maternal and fetal assessment should be conducted to include:
•	
Assessment of the severity of COVID-19 symptoms by a multidisciplinary team (MDT), including an
infectious diseases or general medical specialist.
• Maternal observations including temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations.
• Confirmation of the onset of labour, as per standard care.
• EFM using cardiotocograph (CTG).
o 
In two Chinese case series, including a total of 18 pregnant women infected with COVID-19
and 19 babies (one set of twins), there were eight reported cases of fetal compromise.3,6
Given this relatively high rate of fetal compromise, continuous EFM in labour is currently
recommended for all women with COVID-19.
•	
If the woman attends with a fever, investigate and treat as per RCOG guidance on sepsis in pregnancy,
but also consider active COVID-19 as a cause of sepsis and investigate according to PHE guidance (see
section 4.2 for COVID-19 case definition).
24
If there are no concerns regarding the condition of either the mother or baby, women who would usually be
advised to return home until labour is more established, can still be advised to do so, if appropriate transport is
available.
Women should be given the usual advice regarding signs and symptoms to look out for, but in addition should
be told about symptoms that might suggest deterioration related to COVID-19 following consultation with the
medical team (e.g. difficulty in breathing).
If labour is confirmed, then care in labour should ideally continue in the same isolation room.
4.6.2 Care in labour
The following considerations apply to women in spontaneous or induced labour:
•	
When a woman with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is admitted to the delivery suite, the
following members of the MDT should be informed: consultant obstetrician, consultant anaesthetist,
midwife-in-charge, consultant neonatologist, neonatal nurse in charge and infection control team.
•	
Efforts should be made to minimise the number of staff members entering the room and units should
develop a local policy specifying essential personnel for emergency scenarios.
•	
There is evidence of household clustering and household co-infection.30
Asymptomatic birth partners
should be asked to wash their hands frequently. If symptomatic, birth partners should remain in self-
isolation and not attend the unit. Women should be advised to identify an alternative birth partner,
should the need arise.
•	
Maternal observations and assessment should be continued as per standard practice, with the addition
of hourly oxygen saturations.
o Aim to keep oxygen saturation more than 94%, titrating oxygen therapy accordingly.
•	
If the woman develops a fever, investigate and treat as per RCOG guidance on sepsis in pregnancy, but
also consider active COVID-19 as a cause of sepsis and investigate according to PHE guidance (see
section 4.2 for COVID-19 case definition).
•	
Given the rate of fetal compromise reported in the two Chinese case series,3,6
the current
25
recommendation is for continuous electronic fetal monitoring in labour.
•	
There is currently no evidence to favour one mode of birth over another and therefore mode of
birth should be discussed with the woman, taking into consideration her preferences and any obstetric
indications for intervention. Mode of birth should not be influenced by the presence of COVID-19,
unless the woman’s respiratory condition demands urgent delivery.
o	
At present, where vaginal secretions have been tested for COVID-19, the results have been
negative.
•	
The use of birthing pools in hospital should be avoided in suspected or confirmed cases, given the
inability for healthcare staff to use adequate waterproof PPE and the risk of infection via faeces.
•	
There is no evidence that epidural or spinal analgesia or anaesthesia is contraindicated in the presence
of coronaviruses. Epidural analgesia should therefore be recommended in labour, to women with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to minimise the need for general anaesthesia if urgent delivery is
needed.
• There is no evidence that the use of Entonox is an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP).
•	
Entonox should be used with a single-patient microbiological filter. This is standard issue throughout
maternity units in the UK.
•	
In case of deterioration in the woman’s symptoms, refer to Section 4.7 for additional considerations,
and make an individual assessment regarding the risks and benefits of continuing the labour versus
proceeding to emergency caesarean birth if this is likely to assist efforts to resuscitate the woman.
• When caesarean birth or other operative procedure is advised, follow guidance from Section 4.9.2.
o 
For emergency caesarean births, donning PPE is time-consuming.This may impact on the
decision to delivery interval but it must be done.Women and their families should be told
about this possible delay.
•	
An individualised decision should be made regarding shortening the length of the second stage of
labour with elective instrumental birth in a symptomatic woman who is becoming exhausted or
hypoxic.
26
•	
Given a lack of evidence to the contrary, delayed cord clamping is still recommended following birth,
provided there are no other contraindications.The baby can be cleaned and dried as normal, while the
cord is still intact.
4.6.3 Specific advice regarding Personal Protective Equipment for Labour
General advice from PHE on type and specification of PPE is available here. Particular advice from Public
Health England on type and specification of PPE for maternity settings is available as part of the table here.
Caesarean birth: specific advice on PPE when caring for pregnant women with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
requiring Caesarean birth is detailed in section 4.9.
4.6.4 Elective caesarean birth
Where women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have scheduled appointments for pre-operative care
and elective caesarean birth, an individual assessment should be made to determine whether it is safe to delay
the appointment to minimise the risk of infectious transmission to other women, healthcare workers and,
postnatally, to her infant.
In cases where elective caesarean birth cannot safely be delayed, the general advice for services providing care
to women admitted when affected by suspected/confirmed COVID-19 should be followed (see Section 4.1), as
should the advice on PPE for caesarean birth (see section 4.9).
Obstetric management of elective caesarean birth should be according to usual practice.
4.6.5 Planned induction of labour
As for elective caesarean birth, an individual assessment should be made regarding the urgency of planned
induction of labour for women with mild symptoms and suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If induction of
labour cannot safely be delayed, the general advice for services providing care to women admitted to hospital
when affected by suspected/confirmed COVID-19 should be followed (see Section 4.1).Women should be
admitted into an isolation room; in which they should ideally be cared for the entirety of their hospital stay.
27
4.7 Additional considerations for women with confirmed COVID-19 and
moderate/severe symptoms
The following recommendations apply in addition to those specified for women with no or mild symptoms.
4.7.1 Women admitted antenatally
When pregnant women are admitted to hospital with deterioration in symptoms and suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 infection, the following recommendations apply:
•	
A MDT discussion planning meeting ideally involving a consultant physician (infectious disease specialist
where available), consultant obstetrician, midwife-in-charge and consultant anaesthetist responsible
for obstetric care should be arranged as soon as possible following admission.The discussion and its
conclusions should be discussed with the woman.The following should be included:
o Key priorities for medical care of the woman.
o 
Most appropriate location of care (e.g. intensive care unit, isolation room in infectious disease
ward or other suitable isolation room) and lead specialty.
o 
Concerns among the team regarding special considerations in pregnancy, particularly the
condition of the baby.
•	
The priority for medical care should be to stabilise the woman’s condition with standard supportive
care therapies.
o	
A useful summary on supportive care for adults diagnosed with COVID-19 has been published
by the World Health Organisation (WHO).31
o	
Specific guidance on the management of patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to
critical care has now been published by NICE.32
• Particular considerations for pregnant women are:
o Hourly observations, looking for the number and trends.
o Hourly respiratory rate looking for the rate and trends.
28
- 
Young fit women can compensate for a deterioration in respiratory function and are able
to maintain normal oxygen saturations before they then suddenly decompensate. So a
rise in the respiratory rate, even if the saturations are normal, may indicate a deterioration
in respiratory function and should be managed by starting or increasing oxygen.
o Titrate oxygen to keep saturations >94%.
o	
Radiographic investigations should be performed as for the non-pregnant adult; this includes chest
X-ray and computerised tomography (CT) of the chest. Chest imaging, especially CT chest, is essential
for the evaluation of the unwell patient with COVID-19 and should be performed when indicated, and
not delayed because of fetal concerns.33-35
Abdominal shielding can be used to protect the fetus as per
normal protocols.
o	
Consider additional investigations to rule out differential diagnoses e.g. ECG, CTPA as appropriate,
echocardiogram. Do not assume all pyrexia is due to COVID-19 and also perform full sepsis-six
screening.
o	
Consider bacterial infection if the white blood cell count is raised (lymphocytes usually normal or low
with COVID-19) and commence antibiotics.
o	
Apply caution with IV fluid management.Try boluses in volumes of 250-500mls and then assess for
fluid overload before proceeding with further fluid resuscitation.31
o	
The frequency and suitability of fetal heart rate monitoring should be considered on an individual basis,
taking into consideration the gestational age of the fetus and the maternal condition. If urgent delivery
is indicated for fetal reasons, birth should be expedited as normal, as long as the maternal condition is
stable.
o	
If maternal stabilisation is required before delivery, this is the priority, as it is in other maternity
emergencies, e.g. severe pre-eclampsia.
o	
An individualised assessment of the woman should be made by the MDT to decide whether elective
birth of the baby is indicated, either to assist efforts in maternal resuscitation or where there are
serious concerns regarding the fetal condition. Individual assessment should consider: the maternal
condition, the fetal condition, the potential for improvement following elective birth and the gestation
of the pregnancy.The priority must always be the wellbeing of the mother.
29
o	
There is no evidence to suggest that steroids for fetal lung maturation, when they would usually
be offered, cause any harm in the context of COVID-19. Steroids should therefore be given when
indicated, and certainly prior to 30 weeks, where even one dose may benefit the neonate.As per
standard practice, urgent delivery should not be delayed for their administration.
There are some reports that even after a period of improvement there can be a rapid deterioration. Following
improvement in a woman’s condition, consider an ongoing period of observation, where possible, for a further
24-48 hours. On discharge, advise the woman to return immediately if she becomes more unwell.
4.7.2 Women requiring intrapartum care
In addition to recommendations in Sections 4.8 and 4.9.1, for women with moderate or severe COVID-19
requiring intrapartum care it is also recommended that:
•	
The neonatal team should be informed of plans for the birth of the baby of a woman affected by
moderate to severe COVID-19 as far in advance as possible and should also be given sufficient notice
at the time of birth, to allow them to attend and don PPE before entering the room/theatre.
•	
With regard to mode of birth, an individualised decision should be made, with no obstetric
contraindication to any method except water birth (see above). Caesarean birth should be performed
if indicated based on maternal and fetal condition as in normal practice.
•	
Given the association of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome,36
women with moderate
to severe symptoms of COVID-19 should be monitored using hourly fluid input/output charts. Efforts
should be targeted towards achieving neutral fluid balance in labour, in order to avoid the risk of fluid
overload.
4.8 Postnatal management
4.8.1 Neonatal care
There are limited data to guide the postnatal management of babies of mothers who tested positive for
COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy. Literature from China has advised separate isolation of the
infected mother and her baby for 14 days. However, routine precautionary separation of a mother and a
healthy baby should not be undertaken lightly, given the potential detrimental effects on feeding and bonding.
Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal
care, are kept together in the immediate postpartum period.
30
A risk and benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to individualise care in babies that may be more
susceptible is recommended. We emphasise that this guidance may change as knowledge evolves.
All babies born to COVID-19 positive mothers should be cared for as per RCPCH guidance.37
4.8.2 Infant feeding
It is reassuring that in six Chinese cases, breastmilk tested negative for COVID-19;3
however, given the small
number of cases, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. The main risk of breastfeeding is the
close contact between the infant and the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the
current evidence, we advise that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of
the virus through breastmilk.The risks and benefits of breastfeeding, including the risk of holding the baby in
close proximity, should they be infected, should be discussed with the parents.This guidance may change as
knowledge evolves.
The following precautions should be taken to limit viral spread to the baby:
• Wash hands before touching the baby, breast pump or bottles.
• Avoid coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding.
• Consider wearing a face mask, if available, while feeding or caring for the baby.
• Where a breast pump is used, follow recommendations for pump cleaning after each use.
• Considering asking someone who is well to feed the baby.
For babies who are bottle fed with formula or expressed milk, strict adherence to sterilisation guidelines is
recommended.
Where mothers are expressing breastmilk in hospital, a dedicated breast pump should be used.
4.8.3 Discharge and readmission to hospital
Any mothers or babies requiring readmission for postnatal obstetric or neonatal care during the period of self-
isolation due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are advised to telephone ahead to contact their local unit
and follow the attendance protocol as described in Section 4.1. The place of admission will depend on the level
of care required for mother or baby.
31
4.9 Specific peri-operative advice for healthcare professionals caring for pregnant women with suspected/
confirmed COVID-19 who require surgical intervention
4.9.1 General advice for obstetric/emergency gynaecology theatre
•	
Elective/planned obstetric procedures (e.g. cervical cerclage or Caesarean) should be scheduled at the
end of the operating list.
•	
Non-elective procedures should be carried out in a second obstetric theatre, where available, allowing
time for a full postoperative theatre clean as per local health protection guidance.27
•	
The number of staff in the operating theatre should be kept to a minimum, and all must wear
appropriate PPE.
•	
All staff (including maternity, neonatal and domestic) should have been trained in the use of PPE so that
24-hour emergency theatres are available and possible delays reduced.
•	
Anaesthetic management for women with symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 should be with
reference to anaesthetic guidance.
•	
Departments should consider running dry-run simulation exercises to prepare staff, build confidence
and identify areas of concern to prepare for emergency transfers to the operating theatre.
4.9.2 Advice regarding Personal Protective Equipment for Caesarean birth
Caesarean birth: the level of PPE required by healthcare professionals caring for a woman with COVID-19
who is undergoing a caesarean birth should be determined based on the risk of requiring a general anaesthetic
(GA). Intubation for a GA is an AGP. This significantly increases the risk of transmission of coronavirus to the
attending staff. Regional anaesthesia (spinal, epidural or CSE) is not an AGP.
For the minority of caesarean births, where GA is planned from the outset, all staff in theatre should wear PPE,
with a FFP3 mask.The scrub team should scrub and don PPE before the GA is commenced.
For a non-urgent caesarean birth where regional anaesthesia is planned, the risk of requiring a GA is very small,
as there is no time pressure. In this situation, all staff not required for siting of the regional anaesthetic should
stay outside theatre until the block is effective.
32
The chance of requiring conversion to a GA during a caesarean birth commenced under regional anaesthesia
is small, but this chance increases with the urgency of caesarean birth. In situations where there are risk factors
that make conversion to a GA more likely, the decision on what type of PPE to wear should be judged based
on the individual circumstances. If the risk of requiring conversion to a GA is considered significant, the theatre
team should wear PPE appropriate to a GA in readiness. An example is a woman whose epidural has been
suboptimal during labour, which is ‘topped-up’ for an emergency caesarean birth.
These recommendations will be updated as required as further evidence and advice becomes available.

5. 
Advice for services caring for women following
isolation for symptoms, or recovery from
confirmed COVID-19
5.1 
Antenatal care for pregnant women following self-isolation for symptoms
suggestive of COVID-19
Scheduled antenatal care that falls within the self-isolation period should be rearranged for post-isolation.
No additional tests, including ultrasound assessment of fetal growth, are necessary for women not requiring
hospitalisation for COVID-19.
Even if a woman has previously tested negative for COVID-19, if she re-presents with symptoms that meet the
case definition (section 4.2), COVID-19 should be suspected.
5.2 
Antenatal care for pregnant women following hospitalisation for confirmed
COVID-19 illness
For those recovering after acute illness, further antenatal care should be arranged for after the period of self-
isolation.
Referral to antenatal ultrasound services for fetal growth surveillance is recommended 14 days after resolution
of acute illness. Although there is no evidence yet that fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a risk of COVID-19,
two-thirds of pregnancies with SARS were affected by FGR and a placental abruption occurred in a MERS case,
so ultrasound follow-up seems prudent.38,39
