From the Permanent Secretary
Sir Chris Wormald
Dear Secretary of State,
CoVID19 – MINISTERIAL DIRECTION
As you know the Department and the NHS are fully committed to tackling CoVID-19
as our top priority.
Consistent with the Chancellor’s statements in the Budget, the approach we have been
taking is to ensure that any potential uncertainty about the availability of funding does
not prevent the right and necessary actions being taken at pace. A consequence of
this is that, as we approach the end of the financial year, we cannot be certain that new
covid-19 expenditure can be contained within the Departmental Expenditure Limits
authorised by Parliament for 2019-20 through the Estimates process. Exceeding those
controls would be a breach of Managing Public Money on regularity grounds.
To ensure that this does not introduce any delay to the agreement of spend in support
of our efforts to combat coronavirus, we are therefore seeking your confirmation that
we should continue to approve and spend money on covid-19 issues as needed. This
letter therefore serves as a formal request for a Direction from you to proceed with
such expenditure, even if this means a breach of Parliamentary financial controls.
Let us assure you that nothing in this request in any way undermines our determination
to support as fully as we can the work of the Government, the NHS and the care system
in providing excellent care to the public and to our workforce at this time.
I am copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary (CO), the Comptroller and Auditor
General (NAO) and to the Treasury Officer of Accounts (TOA).
