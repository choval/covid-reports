This information comes from
the Government.
It is about Coronavirus (Covid-19)
which is a new disease that affects
your lungs and breathing.
Coronavirus is spreading quickly
all around the world.
Coronavirus
Most people don’t get very ill with it.
Some people will die if they catch it.
4
Everyone has to help
Everyone has to help to stop
Coronavirus from spreading
so quickly.
This will keep many more people alive.
Stay at home
As many people as possible have to
stay at home.
You have to keep away from
other people.
This will slow down the spread
of Coronavirus.
5
Protect the NHS
The NHS will help people if they
become very ill with Coronavirus.
But if too many people become ill at
the same time, the NHS will not be
able to help them all and many more
people will die.
6
The most important thing you can do
to help the NHS and save lives, is to
stay at home.
You should only leave the house for
one of these reasons:
1. Shopping for things you need
This could be food and medicine.
You should wait a few days 		
between each time you
go shopping.
Stay at home
2. Excerise once a day
This should only be one type of
exercise like a run, a walk or a
bike ride.
Only do this on your own or with
the people you live with.
7
3. Any medical need
For example:
To get medicines.
If you are seriously ill.
Giving blood.
Helping a vulnerable person.
Vulnerable means that you find it
hard to keep yourself safe.
8
4. Travelling to work
This is only if you cannot work
from home.
If you do have to leave
your home:
Spend as little time outside
as possible.
Make sure you are at least
2 metres or 6 feet away from
other people.
You can stay close to people from your
own household.
9
Children
Some children and their parents may
leave their home and go to school.
These are:
Children of people who work in
health or care services, or have
another important job.
Children who are vulnerable.
Children can be moved between homes
if their parents live separately.

Wash your hands with soap
and water often.
Cover your mouth and nose with
a tissue or your sleeve when you
cough or sneeze. Don’t cough or
sneeze into your hand.
Put used tissues in the bin straight
away and then wash your hands.
Help to stop Coronavirus
spreading:
Don’t touch your eyes, nose or 		
mouth if your hands are not clean.
11
Use your normal cleaning products
on things that people touch a lot
in your home, like door handles
and taps.
Think of others when you go
shopping and only buy what
you need.
Follow any advice that they give
you at the shop.

time before they start to feel ill
after catching it.

indoors until they feel better.

they started to feel ill.
