How government works
Some manufacturers are selling products for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in community settings, such as
pharmacies.
The current view by PHE is that use of these products isnot advised:
some of these products look for virus while others look for the body’s immune response to the virus. Such tests are
very rapid and can work on a range of specimens including serum, plasma or finger-prick whole blood
there is little information on the accuracy of the tests, or on how a patient’s antibody response develops or changes
during COVID-19 infection. It is not known whether either a positive or negative result is reliable
currently there is no published evidence about the suitability of these tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection in a
community setting
