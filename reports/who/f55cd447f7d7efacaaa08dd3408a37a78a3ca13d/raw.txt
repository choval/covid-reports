Situation Report – 73
HIGHLIGHTS
• No new countries/territories/areas reportedcases of COVID-19 in the past 24
hours.
• WHO has released a MedicalProduct Alert that warns consumers, healthcare
professionals, and health authorities against a growing number of falsified
medical products that claimto prevent, detect, treat orcure COVID-19. Find
more here.
• WHO is working with Iraqto increase surveillance and response capacities.
WHO has printed hundreds of thousands of prevention and transmission
control messages, takenmobile health teamsto the streets, and delivered
urgent consignments of personal protective equipment (PPE) and laboratory
test kits. Moreinformation can be found here.
• WHO has been working with governmentsand partnersaround theworld,
across many areas of activity: conducting needs assessments, providing hand
sanitizers and masks for health professionals, providing training on theclinical
management of patients with COVID-19, collaborating with local media
outlets and conducting awareness raising activities, delivering test kits,
conducting simulation exercises, and shipping personal protective equipment
through WHO logistical hubs. As an example, WHO EUROhas released a photo
story of WHO’s activitiesin Kyrgyzstan, available here.
• Our understanding of the transmission of COVID-19virus continues to
improve withthe evolution of the outbreak. For more, see ‘Subject in Focus’.
• insights into the virus. For more details, please see ‘Subject in Focus’.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: The routes of transmission from COVID-19 patients
As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, we are learning more about this new virus every day. Here we
summarizewhat hasbeen reportedabout transmission of theCOVID-19virus, and provide a brief overviewof available
evidence on transmission from symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomaticpeople infected with COVID-19.
Symptomatic transmission
By wayof definition, a symptomatic COVID-19case is a case who has developed signs and symptoms compatible with
COVID-19virus infection. Symptomatic transmission refersto transmission from a person while they areexperiencing
symptoms.
Data from published epidemiology and virologic studies provide evidence that COVID-19is primarily transmittedfrom
symptomatic people to others who are in close contact through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected
persons, or by contact with contaminatedobjects and surfaces.1-7 This is supported by detailed experiences shared by
technical partnersvia WHO global expert networks, and reports and presentations by Ministries of Health.
Data from clinical and virologic studies that have collected repeated biological samples from confirmed patients
provide evidence that shedding of the COVID-19 virus is highest in upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) early in
the course of the disease.8-11 That is, within the first 3 days from onset of symptoms.10-11 Preliminary data suggests
that people may be more contagious around the time of symptom onset as compared tolater on in thedisease.
Pre-symptomatic transmission
The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and
symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however can be up to 14 days. During this period, also known as the “pre-
symptomatic” period, some infectedpersons canbecontagious. Therefore, transmission from a pre-symptomatic case
can occur before symptom onset.
In a small number of case reports and studies, pre-symptomatic transmission has been documented through contact
tracing effortsand enhanced investigation of clusters of confirmed cases.12-17 Thisissupported by data suggesting that
some people can test positive for COVID-19 from 1-3 days before they develop symptoms.6,16 Thus, it is possible that
people infected with COVID-19 could transmit the virus before significant symptoms develop. It is important to
recognize that pre-symptomatic transmission still requires the virus to be spread via infectious droplets or through
touching contaminatedsurfaces.
Asymptomatic transmission
An asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case is a person infected with COVID-19 who does not develop symptoms.
Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, and to date, there has been no
documented asymptomatic transmission. This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur. Asymptomatic cases
have been reported as part of contact tracing efforts in some countries.
WHO regularlymonitors allemerging evidence about this criticaltopic and willprovide anupdate asmore information
becomes available.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis ofavailableofficial data and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highe st category for which there is
evidence; they may be removed from a given category ifinterruption oftransmission canbe demonstrated. It should be noted t hateven within
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees oftransmissionas indicatedby the differing numbers of cases and
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.
Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by
increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)
** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions ofsimilar status
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context ofthe United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99).
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number ofnew cases may not always
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports presentofficial counts ofconfirmed
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources ofCOVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different
data cutofftimes are to be expected.

STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health careworkers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,
infection prevention and control in health caresettings, home care for patients with suspected novel
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,

• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalin anoutbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols canbe used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on thecommunity and to inform operationalmodels for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here. One
such protocol is for the investigation of earlyCOVID-19 cases and contacts(the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to
gain anearly understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof thefirst cases of
COVID-19infection detectedin any individual country, to inform thedevelopment and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce thepotential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you arenot in an area whereCOVID-19is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19is
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accuratelydetermineyour
risks so that you cantake reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your
healthcareprovider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurateinformation on COVID-19
and whether COVID-19is circulating whereyou live. It is important tobe informed of the situation and take
appropriatemeasures toprotect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).
If you arein an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to takethe risk of infection seriously. Follow the
advice of WHO and guidanceissued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection
will cause mild illness however, it can makesome people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,
and those withpre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovasculardisease, chronic respiratorydisease or
diabetes) areat risk for severe disease (See Protectionmeasures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areaswhere COVID-19is spreading).
CASE DEFINITIONS
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection withcoronavirus disease (COVID-19)
document which includes casedefinitions.
For easy reference, casedefinitions areincluded below.
Suspect case
A. A patient with acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,
shortness of breath), AND a history of travelto or residence in a location reporting community transmission of
COVID-19disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR
B. A patient with any acute respiratoryillness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19
case (see definition of contact)in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;
OR
C. A patient with severe acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,
cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternativediagnosis that
fully explains theclinical presentation.
Probablecase
A. A suspect casefor whom testing for the COVID-19virus is inconclusive.
a. Inconclusive being the result of the test reportedby the laboratory.
OR
B. A suspect casefor whom testing could not be performed for any reason.
Confirmed case
A person with laboratoryconfirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespectiveof clinical signs and symptoms.
• Technical guidancefor laboratorytesting canbe found here.
Definition of contact
A contact is a person who experienced any one of thefollowing exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:
1. Face-to-facecontact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3. Direct carefor a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
protectiveequipment1; OR
4. Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the14 days
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
