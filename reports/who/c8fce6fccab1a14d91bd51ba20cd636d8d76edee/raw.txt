Situation Report – 91
HIGHLIGHTS
• No newcountry/territory/area reportedcasesof COVID-19inthepast 24hours.
• The urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine underscores the pivotal role
immunizations play in protecting lives and economies. Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge,
WHO Regional Directorfor Europe, marking the European Immunization Week
2020, stressed ‘we must not, especially now, let down our guard on
immunizations’. WHO and UNICEF have released a joint statement to mark
European ImmunizationWeek 2020, which is available here.
• WHO has published a brief on theuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs
(NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19. Concerns have been raised that NSAIDs
may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects. However, as
explained in the brief, at present thereis no evidence of severe adverse effects.
The brief is available here.
• WHOhas recentlypublished anupdated strategytohelpguide the public health
response to COVID-19 which is available here, and is one of the topics for
today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below.
• An update on EmergencyMedical Teams, the Global Health Cluster, the Global
Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Risk Communications and
Community Engagement is also provided in today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS
1. Updated strategy to help guide public health response to COVID-19
WHO published the first StrategicResponse and Preparedness Plan on 3 February 2020. Since then, wehave learnt a
huge amount about COVID-19, and how best to slow and stop it spreading through communities around the world.
WHO has been rapidly translating this new knowledge into guidance for national governments, health workers, and
everyone else involved in theglobal response to COVID-19. On 14 April, WHO published a strategyupdate reflecting
what we have learnt toinform the next iterationof theStrategicPreparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) due in the
coming weeks.
The update is intended to help guide the public health response to COVID-19at national and subnational level. The
update emphasizes the need to tailor theresponse to COVID-19 carefully to local contexts, however, therearesome
important lessons that can be applied in a broad rangeof situations.
One important lesson is that the faster and the more effective we areat finding all suspected cases of COVID-19,
testing, isolating and treating the confirmed cases and tracing their contacts, thenthe harder we makeit for the
virus to spread. This in turnmakes it easier for healthsystems to cope, deliver quality care, and save lives.
This principle applies in all contexts, but it cansometimes be a challengeto put into practiceeven in settings with
ample resources. Together with thewhole UN system, WHO has worked and is continuing to work closely with all
partners and national governments toensure that all populations, but especially themost vulnerable populations,
including those in humanitariansettings, benefit from a coordinated and effective response. Alongside the SPRP,
that applies to all countries, theCOVID-19 Global HumanitarianResponse Plan (issued on 25 March2020), sets out
the most urgent health and humanitarian actions required to prepareand respond to COVID-19in the most fragile
contexts.
The update also sets out key criteria and considerations for countries that areconsidering lifting some of the
widespread restrictions on movement, often termed“lockdowns”, that have been used to suppress the spread of
COVID-19through communities. Byensuring these criteria aremet, it should be possible for countries to sustain a
steady stateof low-level or no transition at thesame time as resuming some social and economic activities.
However, without careful planning, and in the absence of scaled up public health and clinical carecapacities, the
prematurelifting of physical distancing measures is likely to lead to an uncontrolled resurgencein COVID-19
transmission and an amplified second waveof cases.
Finally, the update sets out the shift required in theinternational system to support countries to plan, finance and
implement their response to COVID-19. The world has never faced this scaleof challengebefore. COVID-19 is a truly
global crisis, and the only way to overcome it is together, in global solidarity.
2. Partner Coordination
Emergency MedicalTeams (EMT)
• Over a hundred EMTsand focal points worldwide areworking closely with the EMT Secretariat, andare
continuously engaging in monitoring, guiding, and facilitating national and international COVID-19response
operations. A weekly Global Coordination Call is held, providing the network with updates on current operations,
technical guidance, and sharing of current experiences and practicesfrom various EMT responses to COVID-19.
• As of 19 April, internationalEMTs have deployed to fifteen countries. Thirty-two EMTsare responding nationally
to support and reinforce the local health systems in all Regions.
• The EMT Secretariat met with theRegional Group for the European Region on 17 April. Following discussions,
therewas an agreement for the Secretariat toprovide regularupdates and present the types of support needed
globally in order to raise awarenessand facilitatedeployments of availableEMTs.
• Recently, Chinese EMTswere deployed to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, and UK EMT toZambia. Additional
deployments of Chinese EMTsare under discussion to Algeria, DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and Zimbabwe.
Requests from Botswana, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Yemen arealso being processed.
• The following guidanceand recommendations have been finalized: technicalguidance on COVID-19 community
facilities and treatment centres; recommendations on pre-hospital emergency medicalservices; and
recommendations for medicalsurge capacityand deployments of EMTs. A modularized just-in-time training
packageon COVID-19 for the EMT workforce is currently being finalised.
GlobalHealth Cluster(GHC)
• All 29 countries with IASC activatedHealthClusters/Sectors arereporting confirmed COVID-19 cases. The 900
national and international healthcluster partners areurgently responding to COVID-19specific needs whilst
maintaining essential health services for 65 million people affected by humanitarian crises.
• The GHC is collaborating with other clusters to inform adaptive approaches to implement key public health
actions in complex setting (e.g. isolation in camp-like settingswith Shelter and Camp Coordination and Camp
Management Clusters).
• Updating of the Global HumanitarianResponse Plan (GHRP)has been launched at country and global level,
involving partner consultation, and consideration of including additional countries.
• A GHC COVID-19Task Teamis being established to (i) Identify & promote minimum standards for humanitarian
settings; (ii) support multi-sectoral action; and (iii) intensify advocacy to address unmet needs/ operational
barriers. The Task Teamwill build upon and strengthenexisting global partner initiatives with strong field driven
engagement tocaptureoperational practiceand lessons.
GlobalOutbreak Alert and ResponseNetwork (GOARN)
WHO continues to facilitatedirect and remote technicalassistance to countries through GOARNregionaland global
network of networks to support healthoperation. UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA areembedded in the global
COVID-19incident management teamin Geneva; and aresupporting all pillars of response. Work is ongoing to
launch public information hub on GOARN Knowledge Platform for COVID-19to share resources from partnersand
other stakeholders.
GOARNactivities include:
• Operational coordination;
• Collaboration on training and capacitybuilding, including Field Epidemiology Training Programmes, regionaland
global networks, and alumni networks;
• Roll out and implementation of Go.Data; and
• Response research(including support to COVID-19ResearchInnovation and ResearchRoadmapworking groups).
Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE)
IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO with GOARNsupport are strengthening coordination and collaboration among key
stakeholders at the global and regionallevels in risk communications and community engagement (RCCE). As the
COVID-19pandemic develops into a global humanitariancrisis, there is increasing coordination with IASC Results
Group 2 on Accountability and Inclusion and its humanitarianpartners to join and alignefforts in regardto country
operations, solutions and tools for stronger community engagement andaccountability approaches on theground.
• The RCCE global strategyhas been completed, and is a ‘live’ document that will be revised and enhanced
following the Strategic PreparednessResponse Plan revision and Global HumanitarianResponse Plan
• Strengthenedcoordination of partnerswith a focus on needs of migrants and vulnerable populations,
community engagement inremote populations and addressing reports of stigma and xenophobia.
• Work is ongoing to a launch public information hub for COVID-19on GOARNKnowledge Platform to share
RCCE resources from partnersand other stakeholders, and enable access to RCCE information.
• A rapid consultation on social, cultural, behavioural perspectives in theCOVID-19 response was undertaken.
Briefs were completed on information, misinformation, disinformation and on compliance with physical
distancing measures for COVID-19 and implications for RCCE in Easternand Southern Africa (April 2020). A
GOARNRCCE Data Collection Tools Repository wasdeveloped for rapid access to tools for COVID-19RCCE
data collection. Africa and Asia RCCE coordination groups aretriangulating community insights with the
intent to inform RCCE priorities and strategieswithin these regions.
• A joint “live” guidance has been developed on “Community Engagement andCOVID-19 Movement
Restrictions: Tips for Engaging People in Low-Resource SettingsRemotely and In-Person”.
• Guidance and webinars on engagement withfaith-based organizationsand religious leaders areunderway
this week ahead of Ramadan. A community action guide with tips for individuals and communities to take
simple actions to support and protect people around them during the epidemic is available here.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
§
Transmission classification is based on a process ofcountry/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may
be upgraded or downgraded as new information becomes available. Not alllocations within a given country/territory/area are e qually affected;
countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category reported. With in a given
transmission category, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees oftransmission as indicated by the differing numbersof
cases, recency of cases,and other factors.
Terms:
- No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no confirmed cases (not shown in table)
- Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected
- Clusters of cases: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographiclocation and/or by common exposures
- Community transmission: Countries/area/territories experiencing larger outbreaks oflocal transmissiondefined through an assessmentof
factors including, but not limited to:
- Large numbers ofcases not linkableto transmissionchains
- Large numbers ofcases from sentinel lab surveillance
- Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas ofthe country/territory/area
** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions ofsimilar status
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context ofthe United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99).
†† As the internationalconveyance (DiamondPrincess) is no longer occupied, transmission classification cannot be applied.
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number ofnew cases may not always
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports presentofficial counts ofconfirmed
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources ofCOVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different
data cutofftimes are to be expected.

STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health careworkers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in thecontext of COVID-19 outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and

community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with COVID-19.
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, mathematicalmodelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical careand treatment, infection
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interimguidance for countries, which are
updated regularly.
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to carefor patients with COVID-19.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reducerisk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published an updated recommendations for internationaltraffic in relation to COVID-19outbreak .
• WHO has activatedthe R&D blueprint to acceleratediagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the
response to health emergencies. COVID-19courses canbe found here and courses in additional national
languageshere. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:
o Introduction to Go.Data –Field data collection, chains of transmission and contact follow-up. The
Go.Data toolis availableglobally to WHO staff, member statesand partnersto support outbreak
investigation, focusing on field data collection, contact tracing and visualisation of chains of
transmission.
o A generalintroduction to emerging respiratoryviruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,
Serbian and Turkish);
o Clinical carefor Severe Acute RespiratoryInfections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian
and Vietnamese);
o Healthand safety briefing for respiratorydiseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);
o Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portugueseand Serbian); and
o COVID-19Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 PartnersPlatform to support country
preparedness and response (availablein English and coming soon in additional languages).
• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalin anoutbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols canbe used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on thecommunity and to inform operationalmodels for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here. One
such protocol is for the investigation of earlyCOVID-19 cases and contacts(the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to
gain anearly understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof thefirst cases of
COVID-19infection detectedin any individual country, to inform thedevelopment and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce thepotential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you arenot in an area whereCOVID-19is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19is
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accuratelydetermineyour
risks so that you cantake reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your
healthcareprovider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurateinformation on COVID-19
and whether COVID-19is circulating whereyou live. It is important tobe informed of the situation and take
appropriatemeasures toprotect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).
If you arein an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to takethe risk of infection seriously. Follow the
advice of WHO and guidanceissued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection
will cause mild illness however, it can makesome people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,
and those withpre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovasculardisease, chronic respiratorydisease or
diabetes) areat risk for severe disease (See Protectionmeasures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areaswhere COVID-19is spreading).
CASE DEFINITIONS
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection withcoronavirus disease (COVID-19)
document which includes casedefinitions.
For easy reference, casedefinitions areincluded below.
Suspect case
A. A patient with acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,
shortness of breath), AND a history of travelto or residence in a location reporting community transmission of
COVID-19disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR
B. A patient with any acute respiratoryillness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19
case (see definition of contact)in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;
OR
C. A patient with severe acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,
cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternativediagnosis that
fully explains theclinical presentation.
Probablecase
A. A suspect casefor whom testing for the COVID-19virus is inconclusive.
a. Inconclusive being the result of the test reportedby the laboratory.
OR
B. A suspect casefor whom testing could not be performed for any reason.
Confirmed case
A person with laboratoryconfirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespectiveof clinical signs and symptoms.
• Technical guidancefor laboratorytesting canbe found here.
Definition of contact
A contact is a person who experienced any one of thefollowing exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:
1. Face-to-facecontact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3. Direct carefor a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
protectiveequipment1; OR
4. Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the14 days
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
