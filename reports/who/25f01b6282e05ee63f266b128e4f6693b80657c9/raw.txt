Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Situation Report – 85
HIGHLIGHTS
• No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24
hours.
• WHO has published an updated strategicpreparedness and response plan to
defeat COVID-19. Thedocument takes what wehave learnedso farabout the
virus and translates that knowledge into strategicaction. More details can be
found here.
• The first UNsolidarity flight has departed Addis Ababa carrying vitalCOVID-19
medical supplies to all African nations. WHO cargo includes one million face
masks, as well as personal protective equipment, which will be enough to
protect health workers while treating more than 30 000 patients and
laboratory supplies to support surveillance and detection. More information
is available here.
• PAHO Director, Dr Etienne, calls for “extreme caution” when transitioning to
more flexible social distancing measures. Her speech is available here.
• There is no evidence that oral poliovirus vaccine protects people against
infection with COVID-19 virus. A clinical trialis planned in the USA, and WHO
will evaluate the evidence when it is available. Greater details are available
here.
• WHO continues to provide timely and accurateinformation, in a world where
we have an overabundance of information, some accurateand some not. For
more, see ‘Subject in Focus’ below.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: WHO providing timely and accurate information to dispel the
‘infodemic’
“We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an
infodemic.”
WHO Director-GeneralTedrosAdhanomGhebreyesus
Munich SecurityConference, 15 February2020
An infodemic is an overabundance of information, some accurate
and some not that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy
sources and reliable guidancewhen they need it. It poses a
serious problem for public health since people need this guidance
to know what actions to taketo protect themselves and others, and help mitigatetheimpact of a disease. In the
context of the COVID-19pandemic, the infodemic is exacerbatedby the global scale of the emergency, and
propagatedby the interconnected way that information is disseminated and consumed through social media
platforms and other channels. While the infodemic is a major challenge tooutbreak response, it presents an
opportunity to identify and adapt new preparedness and response tools.
The COVID-19infodemic spans four major thematicareaswhere people look for trustworthyinformation and where
misinformation and rumors areplaced: thecause and origin of the virus and disease; its symptoms and transmission
patterns; available treatments, prophylacticsand cures; and the effectiveness and impacts of interventions by health
authorities or other institutions.
WHO has been managing theinfodemic through a wide rangeof methods such as timely and accuratetechnical
guidance, scientific briefs and situation reports, regularpress conferences, educationalvideos and trainings, “myth-
busters,” activeengagement on social media platforms and tailoredguidance for key sectors such as healthcare,
food and agricultureand traveland tourism, among others.
On 7 and 8 April, theWHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN)held a two-day, global, online consultation
on managing theCOVID-19 infodemic. The consultation collated ideas from an interdisciplinary group of experts and
1,375webinar participants. Over 500 ideas were also submitted through an online interactiveforum. These ideas will
form the basis of a COVID-19 infodemic frameworkto guide actions of governments and public health institutions,
and will be madeavailable in thecoming days.
The framework will be built around four key principles:
1. Interventionsand messages must be based on science and evidence.
2. This knowledge should be translatedinto actionablebehaviour changemessages, presented in ways that are
accessible to all sectors of all societies.
3. Governments should reach out to key communities to understand their concerns and information needs, to better
tailor advice and messages that can help these communities address their audiences.
4. Strategicpartnershipsshould be formed withsocial media and technology platforms and stakeholders, along with
other relevant stakeholders such as those in academia and civil society.
The consultation highlighted clear themes and needs that will be further developed in the framework. They include,
but arenot limited to:
• The need for (a) international coordination of the response to the infodemic, even around such basic
issues as terminology; and (b) coordinated and integratedmethods to managethe flow of information
for maximum positive impact. To fill these gaps, an overview and understanding of the distribution and
sharing of information is crucial.
• Public trust in the health authorityand other relevant authorities is essential to mitigatethe negative
impact of an infodemic. In order to build and sustain trust, public health agenciesand other authorities
need to be transparent about developments as they unfold.
• Healtheducation and health literacyare important to help people receive and act on reliable
information.
• Resilience to misinformation depends on strong digital and health literacy. To facilitatethis, authorities
could run information campaignson how to convey accurateinformation, in a similar waythat they
promote personal hygiene.
• Multidisciplinary cooperation is key to an effective response to an infodemic. The rangeand
effectiveness of possible response measures increases in relationto the degreeof cooperation between
all these actors, across the whole of society.
• Widespread culturalchange around the handling of online information may also be necessary (e.g.
individuals retracting anddeleting inaccurateposts they might have shared).
• Accurateinformation must be adaptedto different cultures, languagesand literacycapacities, extending
to marginalised and vulnerable communities.
• Healtheducation before a crisis is always hugely valuable.
Managing theCOVID-19 pandemic and relatedinfodemic requires swift, regular, coordinated actionfrom multiple
sectors of society and government. The timely translation of evidence into knowledge that people can use, adapted
to their local cultures, languagesand contexts, will continue to be crucialto fighting misinformation and saving lives
as the pandemic continues to evolve.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
§Transmission classification is based on a process ofcountry/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may
be upgraded or downgraded as new information becomes available. Not alllocations within a given country/terr itory/area are equally affected;
countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category reported. With in a given
transmission category, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees oftransmission as indicated by the differing numbersof
cases, recency of cases,and other factors.
Terms:
- No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no confirmed cases (not shown in table)
- Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected
- Clusters of cases: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographiclocation and/or by common exposures
- Community transmission: Countries/area/territories experiencing larger outbreaks oflocal transmissiondefined through an assessmentof

- Large numbers ofcases not linkableto transmissionchains
- Large numbers ofcases from sentinel lab surveillance
- Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas ofthe country/territory/area

†† As the internationalconveyance (DiamondPrincess) is no longer occupied, transmission classification cannot be applied.
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number ofnew cases may not always
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports presentofficial counts ofconfirmed
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources ofCOVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different
data cutofftimes are to be expected.

STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health careworkers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in thecontext of COVID-19 outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and
control in healthcare settings, home carefor patientswith suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and
community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with COVID-19.
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, mathematicalmodelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical careand treatment, infection
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interimguidance for countries, which are
updated regularly.
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to carefor patients with COVID-19.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reducerisk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published an updated recommendations for internationaltraffic in relation to COVID-19outbreak .
• WHO has activatedthe R&D blueprint to acceleratediagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the
response to health emergencies. COVID-19courses canbe found here and courses in additional national
languageshere. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:
o Introduction to Go.Data –Field data collection, chains of transmission and contact follow-up. The
Go.Data toolis availableglobally to WHO staff, member statesand partnersto support outbreak
investigation, focusing on field data collection, contact tracing and visualisation of chains of
transmission.
o A generalintroduction to emerging respiratoryviruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,
Serbian and Turkish);

o COVID-19Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 PartnersPlatform to support country
preparedness and response (availablein English and coming soon in additional languages).
• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalin anoutbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols canbe used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on thecommunity and to inform operationalmodels for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here. One
such protocol is for the investigation of earlyCOVID-19 cases and contacts(the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to
gain anearly understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof thefirst cases of
COVID-19infection detectedin any individual country, to inform thedevelopment and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce thepotential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you arenot in an area whereCOVID-19is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19is
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accuratelydetermineyour
risks so that you cantake reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your
healthcareprovider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurateinformation on COVID-19
and whether COVID-19is circulating whereyou live. It is important tobe informed of the situation and take
appropriatemeasures toprotect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).
If you arein an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to takethe risk of infection seriously. Follow the
advice of WHO and guidanceissued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection
will cause mild illness however, it can makesome people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,
and those withpre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovasculardisease, chronic respiratorydisease or
diabetes) areat risk for severe disease (See Protectionmeasures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areaswhere COVID-19is spreading).
