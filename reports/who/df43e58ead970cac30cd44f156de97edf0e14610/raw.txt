Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Situation Report – 101
HIGHLIGHTS
• WHO reminds healthauthorities to take specific steps to protect health care
workers and communities during essential immunization activities during the
COVID-19pandemic. PAHO has published an articleon this, available here.
• WHO AMRO/PAHODirector, DrCarissa F. Etienne, has urgedfor vaccination
programs to continue during the COVID-19pandemic: “If we fall behind on
routine immunizations, particularly for children, we risk outbreaks, thus
overwhelming hospitals and clinics with preventable diseases in addition to
COVID-19.” Her full statement is available here.
• WHO/EURODirector, DrHans Henri P. Kluge, called for transparent knowledge-
sharing, tailored support on the ground, and steadfast solidarity. His
statement is available here.
• WHO SEARO organizeda meeting yesterday withvaccine manufacturers and
national regulatoryauthorities to discuss future COVID-19vaccine
manufacturing in theRegion. An articleon this is available here.
• WHO endeavours to ensure that all Member Stateshave timely and accurate
testing capacity for COVID-19. In the‘Subject in Focus’ below, we describe
some of the mechanisms WHO uses tosupport Member States.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Detection of disease – an update on laboratory services for COVID-19
Diagnosticlaboratory testing is a cornerstone of the management of the COVID-19pandemic. It allows for the
detection of cases to inform careand for the isolation of infected individuals to interrupt disease transmission.
Confirmatory testing also enables the disease to be trackedin the community and for clusters of cases to be
identified. WHO endeavours to ensure that all Member Stateshave timely and accuratetesting capacityfor COVID-
19. This is done through several mechanisms.
First, a reference laboratorynetwork has been established across the 6 WHO regions, and recentlyexpanded to
include some two dozen laboratories with expertise in virology, diagnostics, sequencing, and often viral culture (see
Figure 2 below). These laboratories act to support Member States that currently do not have testing capacityor need
to get confirmation of their initial test results while building in-country capacity. These samelaboratories serve as a
valuable source of support for strategicplanning for the WHO HQ teamand provide guidance to theWHO Regional
Office laboratory focal points as well. A shipment fund to allow transport of samples to WHO reference laboratories
for confirmatory testing has been made available to cover transport costs.
Second, working with WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, surveillance testing for COVID-19
disease has been established in clinics caring for patientswith respiratory disease, giving an earlyhint to community
penetrationby COVID-19.
Figure 2. WHO COVID-19 ReferenceLaboratory Network
Third, since February 24th WHO has been providing polymerase chain reaction(PCR) kits for COVID-19 directly to
countries, offering Member Statesthe capacityto detect cases or clusters before the disease gains a strong foothold.
The scale of provision of tests is set to rise to millions of tests per month with therecent formation of the
Diagnostics Consortium of donor and technical agenciesconvened by WHO to alignand coordinateprocurement of
validated diagnostic test kits and relatedlaboratory materials.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
§Transmission classification is based on a process ofcountry/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may
be upgraded or downgraded as new information becomes available. Not alllocations within a given count ry/territory/area are equally affected;
countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category reported. With in a given
transmission category, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees oftransmission as indicated by the differing numbersof
cases, recency of cases,and other factors.
Terms:
- No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no confirmed cases (not shown in table)
- Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected
- Clusters of cases: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographiclocation and/or by common exposures

†† As the internationalconveyance (DiamondPrincess) is no longer occupied, transmission classification cannot be applied.
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number ofnew cases may not always
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports presentofficial counts ofconfirmed
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources ofCOVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different
data cutofftimes are to be expected.
The number ofcases for Lithuania has been adjusted retrospectively by Lithuanianauthorities to include only those with positivepolymerase
chain reaction (PCR) test results.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in thecontext of COVID-19 outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and
control in healthcare settings, home carefor patientswith suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and
community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with COVID-19.
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, mathematicalmodelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical careand treatment, infection
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interimguidance for countries, which are
updated regularly.
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to carefor patients with COVID-19.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reducerisk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published an updated recommendations for internationaltraffic in relation to COVID-19outbreak .
• WHO has activatedthe R&D blueprint to acceleratediagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering free online courses to improve the
response to health emergencies. COVID-19resources are hosted on 2 learning channels: one for courses in
official WHO languageshere and a second for courses in additional national languageshere.
o There aremore than 1.5million enrolments in the platform's courses to support the COVID-19
response. Specifically, WHO has developed courses on the following topics:
o A generalintroduction to emerging respiratoryviruses, including novel coronaviruses (available
in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Bengali, Hindi, Hungarian, IndianSign Language,
Indonesian, Macedonian, Persian, Portuguese, Serbian, Turkish and Vietnamese);
STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health careworkers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
o Clinical carefor Severe Acute RespiratoryInfection (SARI) (availablein English, French, Russian,
Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese and Vietnamese);
o Healthand safety briefing for respiratorydiseases – ePROTECT (available in
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);
o Infection Prevention and Control for COVID-19 (available
in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Macedonian, Portuguese, Ser
bian and Turkish);
o COVID-19operational planning guidelines and partners platform to support country preparedness and
response (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Indonesian and Portuguese);
o SARI treatment facility design (available in Arabic, English, Italianand Portuguese);
o An introduction to Go.Data –field data collection, chains of transmission and contact follow-up
(available in English and coming soon in additional languages);
o How to put on and remove personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19(available in English and
coming soon in additional languages); and
o Standard precautions for hand hygiene (availablein English and coming soon in additional languages).
• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalin anoutbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols canbe used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on thecommunity and to inform operationalmodels for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here. One
such protocol is for the investigation of earlyCOVID-19 cases and contacts(the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to
gain anearly understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof thefirst cases of
COVID-19infection detectedin any individual country, to inform thedevelopment and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce thepotential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you arenot in an area whereCOVID-19is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19is
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accuratelydetermineyour
risks so that you cantake reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your
healthcareprovider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurateinformation on COVID-19
and whether COVID-19is circulating whereyou live. It is important tobe informed of the situation and take
appropriatemeasures toprotect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).
If you arein an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to takethe risk of infection seriously. Follow the
advice of WHO and guidanceissued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection
will cause mild illness however, it can makesome people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,
and those withpre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovasculardisease, chronic respiratorydisease or
diabetes) areat risk for severe disease (See Protectionmeasures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
