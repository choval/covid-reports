•

•

•

Four new Member States (Argentina, Chile, Poland and Ukraine) have
reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
The WHO Prequalification Team announced that the Emergency Use Listing
(EUL) is now open to candidate in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) laboratory tests to
detect COVID-19 virus. The EUL procedure is developed to expedite the
availability of IVDs needed in public health emergency situations.
Manufacturers are invited to submit an Expression of Interest. Further
information can be found here.
Disruptions to the global supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) are
leaving healthcare workers ill-equipped to care for patients. WHO is working
with governments, industry and the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to boost
production and secure allocations for critically affected and at-risk countries.
More information can be found here.
The COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners
Platform to support country preparedness and response course in English has
been added to OpenWHO. Please see all COVID-19 courses on OpenWHO

Numbers include both domestic and repatriated cases
*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
†Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.
Terms:
-

Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by
increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).
Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.

-

Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.

-

-

Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and
risk communication.

To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.
WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are
updated regularly.
WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and
Russian); Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory
diseases - ePROTECT (available in English and French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus
(COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); Critical Care Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (available in

•

English and French); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support
country preparedness and response.
WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations
One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your
risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your
healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the
advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection
will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,
and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).

CASE DEFINITIONS
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
document which includes case definitions.
For easy reference, case definitions are included below.
Suspect case
A. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,
cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a
history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation
report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR
B. A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;
OR
C. A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease

(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains
the clinical presentation.
Probable case
A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.
•
Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory
Confirmed case
A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.
