Situation Report – 74
HIGHLIGHTS
• One new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24
hours: Malawi.
• Supporting and protecting older people is everyone’s business: although all
age groups are at risk of contracting COVID-19, older people face significant
risk of developing severeillness. Readthestatement byDrHansHenriP. Kluge,
WHO RegionalDirectorfor Europe here.
• As cases start to climb in the South-East Asia Region, the Regional DirectorDr
Poonam Khetrapal Singh held a virtual meeting with Health Ministers of the
Region calling for a stronger whole-of-society approach. More information
can be found here.
• The Pan American Health Organization(PAHO) launched an appeal yesterday
for funds towards priority public health measures to help Latin American and
Caribbean countries. The funds will be used to implement PAHO's COVID-19
Response Strategy. Further information is available here.
• Ports, airports and ground crossings require careful monitoring. WHO has
produced two online interactive courses to provide guidance for the
management of ill travellers and for managing COVID-19 cases or outbreaks
on board ships. Further details canbe found below in the‘Subject in Focus’

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Online interactive courses for Points of entry
WHO continues to provide technicalguidance in the context of COVID-19for ports, airportsand ground crossings,
including for conveyances. This week twoonline interactivecourses have been published on theWHO COVID-19
website. These are based on guidancedocuments already published that were developed with input from the
InternationalMaritimeOrganization, InternationalCivil Aviation Organization, InternationalAirTransport
Association as well as major industry associations.
The interactivecourses highlight important information reinforce learning through activerecall - by engaging
learners to answer short quizzes and respond to different scenarios in a safe learning environment.
Online courseforthemanagement of ill travellers at point of entry
This interactivee-learning course is based on the WHO InterimGuidance for Management of ill travellersat Points of
Entry – internationalairports, seaports and ground crossings – in the context of the COVID-19outbreak. This course
is intended for National IHR Focal Points, public health authorities and operators at points of entry, conveyance
operators, and other stakeholders.

Online courseforoperationalconsiderations formanaging COVID-19cases/outbreaks on board ships
This course has been developed using the WHO InterimGuidance for Operational considerations for managing
COVID-19cases/outbreak on board ships. It is intended for any authority involved in public healthresponse to a
COVID-19public health event on board ships, including IHR NationalFocal Points (NFP), port healthauthorities, local,
provincial and national healthsurveillance and response systems, as well as port operators and ship operators.

†The designations employed and the presentation ofthe materialin this publication do not imply the expression ofany opinion whatsoeveron
the part ofWHO concerning the legal status ofany country, territory, city or area or ofits authorities, or concerning the delimitation ofits
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.
‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis ofavailableofficial data and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is
evidence; they may be removed from a given category ifinterruption oftransmission canbe demonstrated. It should be noted t hateven within
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees oftransmissionas indicatedby the differing numbers of cases and
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.
Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by
increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)
** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context ofthe United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99).
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number ofnew cases may not always
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports presentofficial counts ofconfirmed
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources ofCOVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different
data cutofftimes are to be expected.
New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.

STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health careworkers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,
infection prevention and control in health caresettings, home care for patients with suspected novel
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, mathematicalmodelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical careand treatment, infection
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interimguidance for countries, which are
updated regularly.
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to carefor patients with 2019-nCoV.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reducerisk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published an updated advice for international trafficin relationto the outbreak of thenovel
coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
• WHO has activatedthe R&D blueprint to acceleratediagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the
response to health emergencies. COVID-19courses canbe found here and courses in additional national
languageshere. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:
o A generalintroduction to emerging respiratoryviruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,
Serbian and Turkish);
o Clinical carefor Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian
and Vietnamese);
o Healthand safety briefing for respiratorydiseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);
o Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portugueseand Serbian); and
o COVID-19Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 PartnersPlatform to support country
preparedness and response (availablein English and coming soon in additional languages).
• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalin anoutbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols canbe used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on thecommunity and to inform operationalmodels for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here. One
such protocol is for the investigation of earlyCOVID-19 cases and contacts(the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to
gain anearly understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof thefirst cases of
COVID-19infection detectedin any individual country, to inform thedevelopment and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce thepotential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you arenot in an area whereCOVID-19is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19is
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accuratelydetermineyour
risks so that you cantake reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your
healthcareprovider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurateinformation on COVID-19
and whether COVID-19is circulating whereyou live. It is important tobe informed of the situation and take
appropriatemeasures toprotect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).
If you arein an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to takethe risk of infection seriously. Follow the
advice of WHO and guidanceissued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection
will cause mild illness however, it can makesome people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,
and those withpre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovasculardisease, chronic respiratorydisease or
diabetes) areat risk for severe disease (See Protectionmeasures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areaswhere COVID-19is spreading).
CASE DEFINITIONS
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection withcoronavirus disease (COVID-19)
document which includes casedefinitions.
For easy reference, casedefinitions areincluded below.
Suspect case
A. A patient with acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,
shortness of breath), AND a history of travelto or residence in a location reporting community transmission of
COVID-19disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR
B. A patient with any acute respiratoryillness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19
case (see definition of contact)in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;
OR
C. A patient with severe acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,
cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternativediagnosis that
fully explains theclinical presentation.
Probablecase
A. A suspect casefor whom testing for the COVID-19virus is inconclusive.
a. Inconclusive being the result of the test reportedby the laboratory.
OR
B. A suspect casefor whom testing could not be performed for any reason.
Confirmed case
A person with laboratoryconfirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespectiveof clinical signs and symptoms.
• Technical guidancefor laboratorytesting canbe found here.
Definition of contact
A contact is a person who experienced any one of thefollowing exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:
1. Face-to-facecontact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3. Direct carefor a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
protectiveequipment1; OR
4. Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the14 days
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
