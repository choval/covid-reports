HIGHLIGHTS
• Two new countries (Lebanon and Israel) reported cases of COVID-19in the
past 24 hours.
• The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19is
not yet clear. On 18 February, a new protocol entitled “Surfacesampling of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical“how to” protocol for health
careand public health professionals” was published. This protocol was
designed to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in
various locations where a COVID-19patient is receiving careor isolated, and
to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus.
• The WHO Director-Generalbriefedthe emergencyministerial meeting on
COVID-19organized by the African Union and theAfrica Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention. Detailscan be found here.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: New protocol for Early Epidemiologic and Clinical Investigations for
Public Health Response
The understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features and risk factors for COVID-19 is currently
limited among the generalpopulation, among health careworkers, in households and in other “closed” settings.
On 18 February, a new master protocol entitled “Surfacesampling ofcoronavirusdisease(COVID-19): A practical
“howto”protocolforhealth careand public health professionals”waspublished.
The role of environmental contaminationin the transmission of COVID-19 is not yet clear. This protocol was designed
to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in various locations where a COVID-19 patient is
receiving care or isolated, and to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus in these
settings. It is important that surface sampling is done as part of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, and that
information obtained by environmental studies is combined with findings from epidemiological and laboratory
investigations.
As a reminder, severalearly investigation masterprotocols andmasterforms for COVID-19 areavailable:

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigationof early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to gain an
early understanding of thekey clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detectedin any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce potentialspread and impact of infection.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in thecontext of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,
infection prevention and control in health caresettings, home care for patients with suspected novel
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to carefor patients with 2019-nCoV.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reducerisk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published an updated advice for international trafficin relationto the outbreak of thenovel
coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
• WHO has activatedof R&D blueprint to acceleratediagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• WHO has developed online courses on thefollowing topics: A generalintroduction to emerging respiratory
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish); Critical Careof Severe Acute
RespiratoryInfections; and Healthand safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT
• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalto carryout earlyin an outbreak of a new
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case
definitions, to characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,
STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contactsand
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international
spread from China*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here:
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical careand treatment, andother ways to identify, managethe
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated
regularly.
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,
clinical management and mathematicalmodelling.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East RespiratorySyndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute RespiratorySyndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 canbe similar. The basic principles to reduce the
generalrisk of transmission of acuterespiratory infections include thefollowing:
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acuterespiratory infections.
• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or theirenvironment.
• Avoiding unprotected contact withfarm or wild animals.
• People withsymptoms of acuterespiratory infection should practice cough etiquette(maintain distance, cover
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practicesin hospitals, especially
in emergency departments.
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory
illness either during or after travel, travellers areencouragedto seek medical attentionand share their travelhistory
with their healthcare provider.
