Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Situation Report – 33
Data as reported by 10AM CET 22 February 2020*

HIGHLIGHTS
•

Two new countries (Lebanon and Israel) reported cases of COVID-19 in the
past 24 hours.

•

The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19 is
not yet clear. On 18 February, a new protocol entitled “Surface sampling of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical “how to” protocol for health
care and public health professionals” was published. This protocol was
designed to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in
various locations where a COVID-19 patient is receiving care or isolated, and
to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus.

•

The WHO Director-General briefed the emergency ministerial meeting on
COVID-19 organized by the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention. Details can be found here.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: New protocol for Early Epidemiologic and Clinical Investigations for
Public Health Response
The understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features and risk factors for COVID-19 is currently
limited among the general population, among health care workers, in households and in other “closed” settings.
On 18 February, a new master protocol entitled “Surface sampling of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical
“how to” protocol for health care and public health professionals” was published.
The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19 is not yet clear. This protocol was designed
to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in various locations where a COVID-19 patient is
receiving care or isolated, and to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus in these
settings. It is important that surface sampling is done as part of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, and that
information obtained by environmental studies is combined with findings from epidemiological and laboratory
investigations.
As a reminder, several early investigation master protocols and master forms for COVID-19 are available:

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international
spread from China*;
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and
risk communication.

To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.
WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.
WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish); Critical Care of Severe Acute
Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT
WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,

severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations
WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated
regularly.
WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,
clinical management and mathematical modelling.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially
in emergency departments.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history
with their health care provider.
