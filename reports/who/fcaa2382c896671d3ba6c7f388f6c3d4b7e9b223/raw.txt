Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Situation Report – 87
HIGHLIGHTS
• No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24
hours.
• Speaking at theCOVID-19media briefing yesterday, WHO Director-GeneralDr
Tedros stressed that our"commitment to public health, scienceand to serving
all the people of the world without fear or favour remains absolute." The
Director-General’sspeechis available here.
• WHO has released a substantial update to its COVID-19 dashboard, offering
better data visualization. The news article is available here and the dashboard
is availableon the WHO COVID-19webpage here.
• Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19: existing rules and
regulations to protect health and reduce harm caused by alcohol such as
restricting access, should be upheld and even reinforced during theoutbreak.
More on this is available here, and a factsheet on Alcohol and COVID-19 is
available here.
• In India, WHO is deploying its national polio surveillance network and other
field staff to help with the COVID-19response Find more on this here.
• Oxygen therapyplays an extremelyimportant role in casemanagement and is
briefly explored in the‘Subject in Focus’ below.

WHO RISK ASSESSMENT
Global Level Very High
SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Case management and oxygen therapy
While themajority of patients with COVID-19have mild or moderatedillness, it is estimatedthat 20% of affected
patients will need oxygen. The ability to boost capacityto deliver oxygen therapy is criticalto being able to treat
those patients and it has implications for thefunctioning of theentire system. WHO has recently published “Oxygen
sources and distribution for COVID-19 treatment centres”, available here, that describes in detail how to surge
oxygen systems and distribution.
In many resource-limited settings, oxygen supply and delivery systems arelimited and thus rapid gapanalysis should
be done to inform surgeactivities. To do so, the COVID-19 Essential Supply Forecast Tool (ESFT), found here, canbe
used to forecast the totalneeds of oxygen and associated consumables and accessories (i.e. essential oxygen
delivery devices and pulse oximeters). The forecast can then be compared to the existing oxygen supply availability.
This method provides a wayto identify a contextually appropriateoxygen surge strategybased on structures,
capabilities, practices and technologies. Decision-makers can then use this strategyto frameand implement a surge
plan.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
§Transmission classification is based on a process ofcountry/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may
be upgraded or downgraded as new information becomes available. Not alllocations within a given country/terr itory/area are equally affected;
countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category reported. With in a given
transmission category, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees oftransmission as indicated by the differing numbersof
cases, recency of cases,and other factors.
Terms:
- No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no confirmed cases (not shown in table)
- Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected
- Clusters of cases: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographiclocation and/or by common exposures
- Community transmission: Countries/area/territories experiencing larger outbreaks oflocal transmissiondefined through an assessmentof
factors including, but not limited to:
- Large numbers ofcases not linkableto transmissionchains
- Large numbers ofcases from sentinel lab surveillance
- Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas ofthe country/territory/area

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context ofthe United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99).
†† As the internationalconveyance (DiamondPrincess) is no longer occupied, transmission classification cannot be applied.
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number ofnew cases may not always
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports presentofficial counts ofconfirmed
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources ofCOVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different
data cutofftimes are to be expected.

STRATEGICOBJECTIVES
WHO’s strategicobjectives for this response areto:
• Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
and health careworkers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;
• Identify, isolate and carefor patients early, including providing optimized carefor infected patients;
• Identify and reduce transmission from theanimal source;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and acceleratethedevelopment of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate criticalrisk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in
health caresettings, implementation of healthmeasures for travelers, awareness-raising in thepopulation and
risk communication.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
• To view all technical guidancedocuments regarding COVID-19, please go tothis webpage.
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on theuse of masks during home careand
in health caresettings in thecontext of COVID-19 outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and
control in healthcare settings, home carefor patientswith suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and
community engagement andGlobal Surveillance for human infection with COVID-19.
• WHO is working closely with InternationalAirTransport Association (IATA)and have jointly developed a
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The
guidance canbe found on the IATAwebpage.
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States wherecases have been reported. WHO is also
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
• WHO is working with its networks of researchersand other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, mathematicalmodelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical careand treatment, infection
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interimguidance for countries, which are
updated regularly.
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to carefor patients with COVID-19.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reducerisk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published an updated recommendations for internationaltraffic in relation to COVID-19outbreak .
• WHO has activatedthe R&D blueprint to acceleratediagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the
response to health emergencies. COVID-19courses canbe found here and courses in additional national
languageshere. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:
o Introduction to Go.Data –Field data collection, chains of transmission and contact follow-up. The
Go.Data toolis availableglobally to WHO staff, member statesand partnersto support outbreak
investigation, focusing on field data collection, contact tracing and visualisation of chains of
transmission.
o A generalintroduction to emerging respiratoryviruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,
Serbian and Turkish);
o Clinical carefor Severe Acute RespiratoryInfections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian
and Vietnamese);
o Healthand safety briefing for respiratorydiseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French,
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);
o Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French,
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portugueseand Serbian); and
o COVID-19Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 PartnersPlatform to support country
preparedness and response (availablein English and coming soon in additional languages).
• WHO is providing guidance on earlyinvestigations, which arecriticalin anoutbreak of a new virus. The data
collected from the protocols canbe used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to
characterizethekey epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,
spectrum of disease, impact on thecommunity and to inform operationalmodels for implementation of
countermeasures such as caseisolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols areavailable here. One
such protocol is for the investigation of earlyCOVID-19 cases and contacts(the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). Theprotocol is designed to
gain anearly understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristicsof thefirst cases of
COVID-19infection detectedin any individual country, to inform thedevelopment and updating of public health
guidance to managecases and reduce thepotential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you arenot in an area whereCOVID-19is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19is
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accuratelydetermineyour
risks so that you cantake reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your
healthcareprovider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurateinformation on COVID-19
and whether COVID-19is circulating whereyou live. It is important tobe informed of the situation and take
appropriatemeasures toprotect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).
If you arein an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to takethe risk of infection seriously. Follow the
advice of WHO and guidanceissued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection
will cause mild illness however, it can makesome people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,
and those withpre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovasculardisease, chronic respiratorydisease or
diabetes) areat risk for severe disease (See Protectionmeasures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areaswhere COVID-19is spreading).
CASE DEFINITIONS
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection withcoronavirus disease (COVID-19)
document which includes casedefinitions.
For easy reference, casedefinitions areincluded below.
Suspect case
A. A patient with acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,
shortness of breath), AND a history of travelto or residence in a location reporting community transmission of
COVID-19disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR
B. A patient with any acute respiratoryillness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19
case (see definition of contact)in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;
OR
C. A patient with severe acute respiratoryillness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,
cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternativediagnosis that
fully explains theclinical presentation.
Probablecase
A. A suspect casefor whom testing for the COVID-19virus is inconclusive.
a. Inconclusive being the result of the test reportedby the laboratory.
OR
B. A suspect casefor whom testing could not be performed for any reason.
Confirmed case
A person with laboratoryconfirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespectiveof clinical signs and symptoms.
• Technical guidancefor laboratorytesting canbe found here.
Definition of contact
A contact is a person who experienced any one of thefollowing exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:
1. Face-to-facecontact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3. Direct carefor a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
protectiveequipment1; OR
4. Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the14 days
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
