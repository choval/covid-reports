RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the
EU/EEA and the UK– ninth update
23 April 2020
Summary
Since 31 December 2019 and as of 22 April 2020, approximately 2.5 million (2 524 812) cases of COVID-19 have been
reported worldwide and 177 780 deaths. Of these, 988 241 cases were reported by EU/EEA countries and the UK,
including 105 064 deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to EU/EEA countries and the UK, which have been
experiencing widespread transmission of the virus in the community for several weeks. In addition, there has been an
increasing number of reports of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes across Europe with high associated
mortality, highlighting the extreme vulnerability of the elderly in this setting.
The absence of an effective treatment or a vaccine combined with an exponential growth in infections from late
February, led many countries to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions such as ‘stay-at-home’ policies
(recommended or enforced) alongside other community and physical distancing measures such as the cancellation of
mass gatherings, closure of educational institutions and public spaces. This approach has collectively reduced
transmission and the 14-day incidence in the EU/EEA and the UK overall has declined by 18% since 8 April. In 20
EU/EEA countries, it appears that the initial wave of transmission has passed its peak, with a decline in the number of
newly reported cases.
Although this decline has been observed, these measures are highly disruptive to society, both economically and
socially. This is why there is significant interest in defining a sound approach to adjusting the measures and phasing
out ‘stay-at-home’ policies. However, lifting measures too quickly, without appropriate monitoring and health system
capacity in place, may cause a sudden resurgence of sustained community transmission.
The question is therefore how Member States can minimise the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems and
citizen’s health while restarting economic and social activities. The Joint European Roadmap towards lifting COVID-19
containment measures addresses this question by providing a framework for a comprehensive economic and social
recovery plan for the EU, with public health actions at its core.
The overall aim of this rapid risk assessment is to provide the European Commission and Member States with a set of
public health objectives and considerations for epidemiological criteria, indicators and accompanying measures,
supporting the implementation of this roadmap based on the available scientific evidence:
 Public health objectives
 Reduce morbidity, severe disease and mortality in the population through proportionate non-medical
countermeasures, with emphasis on protecting vulnerable (high-risk) groups, until effective vaccines,
treatments and medicines become available.

 Limit and control virus circulation and transmission in the general population now (flattening the curve)
and for the years to come to maintain the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections at manageable levels
for the healthcare system, and possibly allowing for gradual acquisition of population immunity.
 A robust surveillance strategy based on enhanced testing, which thoroughly and continuously monitors the
panemic by gathering comparable data among Member States, monitors the intensity and geographical spread,
detects nosocomial outbreaks, identifies and monitors changes in risk groups, provides information about age-
specific population immunity, measures the impact on healthcare systems, monitors viral changes and
measures the impact of mitigation and physical distancing measures (and their adjustments) through
appropriate epidemiological indicators and criteria.
 An expanded testing capacity and harmonised testing methodologies for the purpose of
epidemiological surveillance, early detection and isolation of cases, clinical management, contact tracing,
protecting risk groups, assessing population immunity, return-to-work strategies. This includes alignment of
testing methodologies, development and ramping up of sustained COVID-19 diagnostic capacity, set-up of
adequate testing schemes, validation and rollout of serological testing.
 A framework for contact tracing, based on extensive testing, active case finding, early detection of cases,
isolation of cases, quarantine and follow-up of contacts, possibly supported by electronic tools and
applications.
 Sufficient healthcare capacity and resilience, including recovered general capacity (not related to COVID-
19) and sufficient hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Monitoring and estimating resource-needs is
crucial to ensure that healthcare systems have the capacity to respond to a new surge in cases. Prioritisation
should be given to build capacities related to medical, IPC, laboratory and contact tracing equipment as well as
human resources.
 An assessment of the response to COVID-19 so far, to identify best practices and lessons learned that
can in turn strengthen future response measures. After-action reviews (AARs) and in-action reviews (IARs) can
be conducted to assess both capabilities and capacities for the implementation of response strategies.
 A strong risk communication strategy to inform and engage the public and vulnerable groups explaining
the rationale behind phasing out ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjustment of community measures.
 In the present situation, where several countries are still experiencing sustained community transmission and
other countries are planning to ease community-level physical distancing measures, the risk assessment will
consider the following questions:
 What is the risk, as of 22 April 2020, of severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
general population in the EU/EEA and UK?
 What is the risk, as of 22 April 2020, of severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in
populations with defined factors associated with elevated risk for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK?
 What is the risk of resurgence of sustained community transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK in the
coming weeks, as a consequence of phasing out ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjusting community level
physical distancing measures without appropriate systems and capacities in place?
What is new in this update?

1. Event background
Since ECDC’s eighth risk assessment published on 8 April 2020, and as of 22 April 2020, 1 207 826 new cases and
103 715 new deaths have been reported worldwide, out of a total of 2 524 812 reported cases and 177 780
reported deaths since 31 December 2019 (Figures 1a and 1b, Annex 2).
The majority of global cases and deaths reported in the period 8 to 22 April 2020 (total of 1 207 826 cases
globally) have been in the United States of America (USA) (456 845 new cases i.e. 38% of total cases and 34 074
new deaths i.e. 33% of total, Figure 1b, Annex 2) and in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK) (379 741 new
cases i.e. 31% of total and 54 005 i.e. 52% of total new deaths, Figure 1a, Annex 2).
Globally, sustained declines have been observed for several weeks in Hubei Province, China and in South Korea;
conversely, reported cases are increasing in Japan, Russia, Singapore, and the USA (Figure 3a, Annex 3).
The main developments in the EU/EEA and the UK since the risk assessment dated 8 April 2020 can be
summarised as follows:
 Most of the new cases (379 741) in the EU/EEA and the UK have been reported in the UK (77 436, 20% of
total new cases in EU/EEA and the UK), Spain (69 146; 18%), Italy (51 410; 14%) Germany (46 469;
12%), and France (42 934; 11%), as of 22 April 2020 (Figure 1).
 The 14-day incidence of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK, providing an estimate of the
prevalence of active cases in the population, is 68.1 per 100 000 population as of 22 April. The 14-day
incidence is heterogeneous across EU/EEA countries and the UK (Figure 2 and Figures 3b-3e, Annex 3),
ranging from 5.3 per 100 000 population in Greece to 210.7 per 100 000 population in Ireland. The 14-day
incidence rates are over 100 cases per 100 000 population in Belgium (163.8), Spain (135.6), the United
Kingdom (110.7) and Luxembourg (105.6).
 The 14-day EU/EEA and the UK incidence has decreased by 18% since the peak of 83.5 cases per 100 000
population on 9 April 2020. As of 22 April 2020, 20 out of 31 countries in the EU/EEA and UK have
witnessed decreasing trends in COVID-19 incidence, with incidence at least 10% lower than peaks which
occurred 7–20 days earlier (Figure 3 and Figures 3b-3e, Annex 3). In eight countries (Belgium, Bulgaria,
Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Slovakia), no substantial change in incidence has
been noted. In three countries (Ireland, Sweden and the UK), the 14-day incidence is increasing and is
currently at the highest level observed in each country since the start of the pandemic. Many EU/EEA
countries are only testing severe or hospitalised cases and therefore incidence trends should be interpreted
with caution.
 The cumulative rate of COVID-19 deaths per 1 000 000 population is 202.4 for the EU/EEA and the UK,
however there is a considerable variation in the incidence of total reported deaths, ranging between 2.6
(Slovakia) and 523.6 (Belgium) per 1 000 000 population. Deaths continue to increase in 27 countries,
whereas four countries have reported no increase in deaths in the last five days. All-cause excess mortality
may be a more objective measure of the impact of the pandemic, particularly at this time of year when
competing drivers (influenza and high/low temperatures) are largely absent. The latest data from the
European all-cause mortality monitoring system (EuroMOMO) for weeks 12–15 (22 March-12 April) show
considerable excess mortality in multiple countries, affecting both the 15–64 and 65+ years age groups in
the pooled analysis with more countries affected over time [3] (Annex 4). The number of deaths in recent
weeks should, however, be interpreted with caution as adjustments for delayed registrations may be
imprecise.
 All EU/EEA countries and the UK implemented a range of measures to respond to the pandemic. Most
countries implemented these in mid-late March. Following a reduction in the virus transmission, several
countries (e.g., Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Slovenia) have started to ease their mitigation
measures by, for example, re-opening primary schools and daycare centres (e.g., Denmark, Norway) and
small retail shops (e.g., Austria, Germany, Italy, Slovenia) (Annex 5). In countries implementing different
measures, the median time between the implementation of the measure and the observed peak number of
reported daily cases (as of 22 April) was 23 days for mass gatherings, 18.5 days from the closure of public
spaces, 20 days from the closure of educational institutions including daycare centres, 23.5 days from the
implementation of ‘stay-at-home’ recommendations for risk groups or the general population and 14 days
from enforced ‘stay-at-home’ policies.

2. Disease background
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China. On 9 January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this
outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Disease
Symptoms
By 21 April 2020, 389 850 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported as case-based data to The European
Surveillance System (TESSy). Information on symptoms was available for 100 233 cases from 12 countries; the
majority reported by Germany (94%), Portugal (3%) and the Czech Republic (2%). Among these cases, the most
commonly reported clinical symptom was fever/chills (48.7%), dry or productive cough (24%), sore throat
(11.8%), general weakness (8.4%), pain (6.9%), runny nose (3.6%) and diarrhoea (1.7%). These figures may not
be representative for all COVID-19 cases, given the variation between countries in the frequency of symptoms
reported, possibly reflecting differences in testing policies or recording clinical history. Among countries with
information on symptoms available for more than 100 cases, the most common symptoms remained cough (22–
83%, six countries) and fever (25–70%, five countries). Pooled and country-specific TESSy data will soon be
available in an online weekly report, published on the ECDC website.
In interviews of 48 healthcare staff in King County, USA, the most common initial symptoms were cough (50.0%),
fever (41.7%), and myalgias (35.4%) [5]. US CDC also lists chills, repeated shaking without chills, headache and a
loss of taste or smell as possible symptoms of COVID-19 [6]. In addition, conjunctivitis has been reported as a
symptom [7].
Increasing evidence suggests that severe COVID-19 is associated with coagulopathy presenting as thrombosis in
various organs [8-10]. Among 184 COVID-19 cases admitted to ICUs in the Netherlands receiving standard
thromboprophylaxis, 31% developed thrombotic complications, mainly venous thromboembolism (27%) or arterial
thrombosis (2.7%) [11]. Both large vessels as well as small vessels are affected with manifestations ranging from
pulmonary embolism to purpuric lesions on the extremities. In autopsies of COVID-19 cases in São Paulo, Brazil, a
variable number of small fibrinous thrombi in small pulmonary arterioles of lung parenchyma was observed, in
addition to exudative/proliferative diffuse alveolar damage [12]. In addition to thrombosis, cardiac damage
(cardiomyopathy), acute kidney injury and encephalitis has been reported in severe cases.
Severity
In China and the US, hospitalisation has occurred in 10.6% and 20.7–31.4% of cases reported respectively [13,14].
Median length of stay in intensive care units (ICU) has been reported to be around seven days for survivors and eight
days for non-survivors, though evidence is still limited [15-18]. On 4 April, the UK’s Intensive Care National Audit and
Research Centre reported 690 patients in critical care, with a length of stay in ICU of four days for survivors and five days
for non-survivors (interquartile range (IQR) 2–8 days for survivors and 3–8 days for non-survivors) [19].
Estimates of five different indicators of severity from two populations of cases (all cases and hospitalised cases)
presented below are based on data available to ECDC as of 22 April 2020. As more countries have moved toward
testing only hospitalised individuals for COVID-19, the proportion of all cases that are hospitalised has increased as
compared to previous analyses.

Long-term consequences of COVID-19 infections
In addition to respiratory sequelae, such as lung fibrosis, severe COVID-19 may lead to cardiovascular sequelae,
such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure [20].

Infection and transmission
Basic reproduction number (R0) and effective reproductive number (Re)
A recent review of 12 modelling studies based on stochastic and statistical methods reports the mean basic
reproductive number for COVID-19 − defined as average number of secondary infections produced by a case of an
infection in a fully susceptible population − at 3.28, with a median of 2.79. This is in accordance with recent
estimations in Italy with R0 estimates between 2 and 3 depending on the region considered [21]. When outbreak
control interventions are in place and the population cannot be considered as fully susceptible, transmission
potential at a given time can be estimated by the effective reproductive number (or time-dependant reproductive
number). The introduction of mitigation measures has been reported to decrease the Re in all regions of Italy,
notably after blanket physical distancing measures were implemented at the national level [21] . In Germany, the
Re remains around one or below since the 22 March [22]. A scientific report (not peer-reviewed) from Flaxman et
al. (Imperial college, UK) on data form 11 European countries reported an initial reproduction number R0 estimate
of 3.87 [95% CI 3.01-4.66]. This study highlights a noticeable decrease in Re following the combined non-
pharmaceutical interventions in several European countries [23].
Incubation period
Current estimates suggest a median incubation period from 5–6 days for COVID-19, with a range from 1–14 days.
One study reported that in 97.5% of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 compatible symptoms will
appear within 11.5 days [24]. A recent modelling study confirmed that it remains prudent to consider the
incubation period to be up to 14 days [25,26]. Based on another modelling study, infectiousness was estimated to
start from 2.3 days (95% CI, 0.8–3.0 days) before symptom onset and to peak at 0.7 days (95% CI, −0.2–2.0
days) before symptom onset [27].
Viral shedding
Over the course of infection, the virus has been identified in respiratory tract specimens 1–2 days before the onset
of symptoms, and it can persist for up to eight days after the onset of symptoms in mild cases [28], and for longer
periods in more severe cases, peaking in the second week after infection [29,30]. The high viral load close to
symptom onset suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmissible at an early stage of infection [31]. Viral RNA
has been detected in faeces [32], whole blood [15], serum [33,34], saliva [26,31], nasopharyngeal specimens
[35], urine [36] and ocular fluid [7]. In an analysis of data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-
analysis of findings from publications, viral RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3%–
57.9%) of the patients—even in stool collected after the respiratory samples tested negative [37]. It should be
noted that detection of viral RNA by PCR does not equate with infectivity, unless infectious virus particles have
been confirmed through virus isolation and cultured from the particular samples. In a case with conjunctivitis,
SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from a specimen on day three post symptom onset and viral RNA was detected up
to day 21 in ocular fluid [7]. In a retrospective study of 113 symptomatic patients, the median duration of SARS-
CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13–22 days) as measured from illness onset. When
comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (≥15 days after illness onset), prolonged
SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitant with
hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission
(p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025). Patients with longer
SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (p<0.001) and focal absorption on
radiograph images (p<0.001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance [38].
Infection in asymptomatic individuals
Asymptomatic infection at time of laboratory confirmation has been reported from many settings [39-42]. Some of
these cases developed some symptoms at a later stage of infection, however, the proportion of cases that will
develop symptoms is not yet fully understood [43,44]. There are also reports of cases remaining asymptomatic
throughout the whole duration of laboratory monitoring, which revealed viral RNA shedding in various sample
types. A recent modelling study suggested that asymptomatic individuals might be major drivers for the growth of
the COVID-19 pandemic [45].
For more information on asymptomatic infection, please refer to ECDC’s seventh RRA update and to the website
[46].
Transmission by pre-symptomatic individuals
Pre-symptomatic transmission has been reported; exposure in these cases occurred 1–3 days before the source
patient developed symptoms [47]. It has been inferred through modelling that, in the presence of control
measures, pre-symptomatic transmission contributed to 48% and 62% of transmissions in Singapore and China
(Tianjin data), respectively [48]. Based on the data from within and outside mainland China, 44% (95% confidence
interval, 25–69%) of secondary cases were estimated to be infected during the index cases’ pre-symptomatic stage
[27]. Although transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals has also been reported, the risk of
transmission from pre-symptomatic or symptomatic patients is considered to be higher; viral RNA shedding is
higher at the time of symptom onset and declines after days or weeks [31].

For more information on pre-symptomatic infection, please refer to ECDC’s seventh RRA update [46] and the page
on COVID-19 disease background [49] on ECDC’s website.
Co-infections
A study performed at multiple sites in northern California testing 1 217 nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic
patients showed that of the 116 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2, 20.7% were positive for one or more
additional pathogens. The most common co-infections were rhinovirus/enterovirus (6.9%), respiratory syncytial
virus (5.2%), and seasonal coronaviruses (4.3%) [50]. The presence of a non–SARS-CoV-2 pathogen may not
provide reassurance that a patient does not also have SARS-CoV-2.
Virus and blood donation
Four SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive blood donations from asymptomatic donors were detected during a routine and
retrospective laboratory screening in Wuhan Blood Centre, China [51].
Data from Germany on a small number of patients showed that no SARS-CoV-2 genome could be detected in the
blood of asymptomatic patients or in patients with less pronounced symptoms. Virus genome was only found in the
serum of a seriously ill patient. Therefore, authors concluded that the risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through
blood components in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seemed negligible but that further studies
were needed [52]. To assess the risk of COVID-19 transmission through the transfusion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-
positive donations, it is necessary to prove whether the detectable RNA in blood is infectious. Transfusion-
transmitted COVID-19 has not yet been reported. It is therefore suggested that blood safety measures should be
maintained [53].
Infection and transmission in different population groups
Elderly residents of long term care facilities and nursing homes
A high proportion of long term care facilities (LTCFs) and nursing homes across Europe and the world have been
severely affected by COVID-19. High morbidity and mortality in residents as well as high rates of staff absence due
to SARS-CoV-2 infections have been observed [54-56]. The proportion of cases that have died in LTCFs out of the
total number of reported deaths exceeds 50% in some countries and underlines the severe impact of COVID-19 on
the elderly and frail population [54]. In France, where a dedicated notification system for cases reported within
LTCF and nursing homes is in place, between 1 March to 14 April 2020, a total of 5 340 facilities have reported
cases with 54 493 confirmed and probable cases of which 6 517 (12%) died [57]. In Ireland, of the reported 444
deaths, 245 (55.2%) were linked to nursing home residents as of 13th April and a high number of outbreaks have
been reported from LTCFs [58]. Norway reported 105 of all 163 (63%) fatal cases from home care or other health
institutions [59]. Germany reported 14 228 infections (8 592 in residents and 5 636 in staff) related to institutions
caring for the elderly (long-term care, nursing homes), disabled people, or being homeless, migrants, or in prisons
[60]. In Belgium as of 21 April, more than 50% of the overall 5 998 COVID-19 related fatal cases have been
reported from LTCFs and similar settings [61]. In Spain as of 16 April, 10 924 (52.7%) out of the 19,516 total fatal
cases linked to COVID-19, were in care home residents [62]. Of 10 337 deaths involving COVID-19 registered up
to week 15 in the United Kingdom, 1 043 (10%) occurred in care homes, with doubling number of deaths in care
homes for week 15 [63]. Scotland reported that 43% of the adult care home institutions reported at least one
suspected case [64].
Underlying health conditions among hospitalised, ICU-admitted and fatal cases
Data from Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and the US provide proportions of
people with underlying health conditions among COVID-19 cases with severe disease and death. These proportions
should be seen in light of the prevalence of these conditions in the underlying populations. Overall, the male to female
ratio in critically ill patients is 2.7. Underlying health conditions reported among patients with COVID-19 and admitted to
ICU include hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, immune compromised status,
cancer and obesity [65-73].

Healthcare workers
Of the confirmed cases in China, 3.8% (1 716/44 672) were healthcare workers. Of those, 14.8% were severely or
critically ill and five of the severe cases died [74]. Latest figures reported from Italy show that 10% of COVID-19
cases are healthcare workers [69], with the Lombardy region reporting up to 20% of cases in healthcare workers
[75]. In Spain, the latest COVID-19 situation overview from the Ministry of Health reports that 20% of COVID-19
cases are in healthcare workers [66]. In the US, overall, only 3% (9 282/315 531) of reported cases were among
healthcare workers; however, among states with more complete reporting, healthcare workers accounted for 11%
of reported cases [76]. In a Dutch study, healthcare workers were tested voluntarily for COVID-19 and 6% tested
positive [77]. In a report on 30 cases in healthcare workers in China, all cases had a history of direct contact
(distance within 1 metre) with COVID-19 patients, with an average number of 12 contacts (7 ̶16), and the average
cumulative contact time being two hours (1.5 ̶2.7) [78]. In the Dutch study, only 3% of healthcare workers
reported being exposed to hospital patients with COVID-19 prior to onset of symptoms and 63% had worked while
asymptomatic [77]. In the US, from 1 423 healthcare workers, 55% reported a known contact with a laboratory-
confirmed COVID-19 patient in the 14 days before illness onset [76].
Children
Similar to SARS and MERS, it appears that COVID-19 infections are less frequently observed in children and
present with milder symptoms than in adults [79]. It appears that children are less likely to be tested due to the
mild presentation of disease [79]. In a large case series from China, including 2 135 paediatric cases, only 34.1%
of the cases were laboratory-confirmed [80]. In the same study, 4.4% of the children were asymptomatic [80].
Although the course of disease in children tends to be milder, shorter and with respiratory or gastrointestinal
symptoms [79], severe disease has also been reported. Reports from China indicate that between 2.5% and 5.2%
of paediatric cases had severe disease [80,81]. Critically ill children accounted for less than 1% of all reported
cases in China [82,83]. Recent data from the US showed that 5.7% of paediatric cases were hospitalised, a
majority of them were infants [84]. Three fatal cases were also reported in the US, although their cases histories
are under review to confirm whether COVID-19 was the cause of death [84]. Few fatal paediatric cases have been
reported in Europe and the Americas, as summarised in the eighth update of ECDC’s Rapid Risk Assessment [85]
Children are likely infected in their households [79]. Two studies on household transmission estimated the
household secondary attack rate (SAR) to be 16.3% [86] and 13.8% [87]. Age-stratified analysis showed that the
SAR in children was 4.7% compared with 17.1% in adults (≥ 20 years of age) [86], and that the odds of infection
in children was 0.26 times (95%CI 0.13-0.54) of that among the elderly (≥ 60 years of age) [87].
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020

Child-to-adult transmission appears to be uncommon. In the investigation of the first outbreak in France, one
infected child attended three different schools while symptomatic and despite 112 contacts identified(including
children and teachers), no symptomatic secondary cases were detected [88]. There are few case reports, with
poorly documented data, describing a paediatric case as potential source of infection for adults [32,89]. Data from
population-based and cross-sectional studies indicate that children are unlikely to be primary source cases. In Vo’
(Italy), two cross sectional studies, including more than 2 000 people each, showed that none of the 234 children
(≤10 years of age) tested were infected [90]. Among the 11-20 year old inhabitants, 1.2% and 1.0% tested
positive in the two surveys compared to the population averages of 2.6% and 1.2%, respectively [90]. In a
population-based screening programme in Iceland, none of the 848 children under 10 years of age tested positive,
in comparison to 0.8% of the whole sample of 13 080 people [91]. In a targeted testing of symptomatic people, or
high-risk contacts, 38 (6.7%) children under the age of 10 tested positive, in comparison to 13.7% of those who
were 10 years or older [91]. In the Stockholm Region (Sweden), a cross-sectional study including 707 participants
(147 were children <15 years of age) reported an overall positivity rate of 2.5% and 2.8% among children [92].
Pregnant women and neonates
Clinical manifestations in pregnant women and neonates are predominantly mild, with few reports of severe
disease and fatal outcomes [93]. Recent data from the US highlight the relevance of screening pregnant women
due to the high proportion of asymptomatic cases among them. Two studies from New York reported that 87.9%
[94] and 32.6% [95] of pregnant women with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 at admission for delivery
were asymptomatic. Similar findings have been reported in Sweden where 7% of asymptomatic pregnant women
were confirmed to be infected at admission for delivery [96].
Intrauterine transmission, although apparently unlikely, cannot be ruled out. One case report from Iran showed
positive RT-PCR results in amniotic fluid and the neonate’s nasopharyngeal swabs (taken 24hrs after birth), and
negative results from the mother’s vaginal secretion, umbilical cord blood, and the neonate’s nasopharyngeal
swabs (taken immediately after birth) [97]. Two studies reported increased levels of IgM and IgG antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 in neonates born to confirmed maternal cases of COVID-19 [98,99].
SARS-CoV-2 virus
Virus evolution
There is currently no evidence that any of the mutations accumulated since the introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in
the human population have any effect on disease characteristics. Over 10 000 genome sequences have been deposited
in the GISAID EpiCoV database as of 22 April 2020 (www.gisaid.org). Mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the
spike glycoprotein are of interest as they may affect infectivity and host-specificity [100]. The structure of the spike
protein has recently been determined [101,102]. Some mutations in this domain have been reported [103], but these
have so far been rare and are not present in any of the major SARS-CoV-2 clades. Mutations in primer binding sites for
published RT-PCR detection assays have so far been rare, these mutations are shown in the ECDC Primerscan tool [104].
Seasonality
The transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 depends on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of
control measures, duration of host immunity to SARS-CoV-2, cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other
human coronaviruses, and potentially seasonal factors. Like other human coronaviruses that show peak incidences
in the winter months, SARS-CoV-2 might display similar seasonal patterns [105-108]. However, whether climatic
factors, such as temperature, humidity or UV, will suffice to supress the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 during the
summer months in the Northern Hemisphere remains to be seen. Modelling the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamic
based on other human coronaviruses suggests that it can drop from winter peak to summer peak by 20% but can
still generate substantial outbreaks (R0>1) if no control measures are in place [109].
For information on seasonality and survival in the environment, please refer to ECDC’s seventh update of the risk
assessment and the page on COVID-19 disease background [49] on ECDC’s website.
Immune response, immunity and treatment
Vaccines
There is a large global effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines and at least three vaccines have entered clinical trials,
including phase II trials [110,111]. This is a rapidly evolving field as candidates move into the development and
testing pipeline. However, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) expects that it may take at least one year before
a vaccine is approved and available for widespread use.
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020

Cell-mediated immune response
Decreased absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+
T cells, and CD8+
T cells were observed in both mild cases
and severe cases, although the decrease was more accentuated in the severe cases. The expression of IFN-γ by
CD4+
T cells tends to be lower in severe cases than in moderate cases [112]. Total lymphocytes, CD4+
T cells,
CD8+
T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells showed a significant association with inflammatory status in COVID-19,
especially CD8+
T cells and CD4+
/CD8+
ratio. In multivariate analysis, post-treatment decrease in CD8+
T cells and
B cells and increase in CD4+
/CD8+
ratio were indicated as independent predictors of poor treatment outcome
[113].
Antibody-mediated immune response
Correlates of protection for COVID-19 have not yet been established and the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-
2 does not indicate directly protective immunity especially if a neutralisation assay has not been used as the
detection method. Based on the currently available data, the IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 develop
between 6–15 days post disease onset [114-119]. The median seroconversion time for total antibodies (Ab), IgM
and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14 post symptom onset, respectively. The presence of antibodies was
detected in <40% among patients within 1-week from onset, and rapidly increased to 100% (total Ab), 94.3%
(IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) from day-15 after onset [120]. It is too early to know how long the protective immune
response against SARS-CoV2 will last, as this will require longitudinal serological studies that follow patients’
immunity over an extended period of time [121].
The possibility of re-infection and the duration of immunity still remain to be studied. Primary infection with SARS-
CoV-2 was shown to protect rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge and casts doubts on reports that the re-
positivity observed in discharged patients is due to re-infection [122].
Testing population immunity
Population-based seroepidemiological studies have been started in some EU/EEA Member States (Table 3).
Preliminary results from Denmark [123,124], Finland [125], France [126], Netherlands [127,128], United Kingdom
(Scotland) [129] and Santa Clara County, USA [130] show that 1-3.4% of healthy adult blood donors - patients
examined for other diseases than infectious diseases or population based on convenience sample - had antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the period 20 March-12 April. In Gangelt municipality, Germany, in a household study
in a highly-affected area, the proportion of positive specimens was 14% in early April [14]. In addition, in
Denmark, in the capital area, the preliminary results of an antibody screening by a rapid test of healthcare
employees showed that infection among health professionals is at 4.1% [131].
These estimates provide a consistent picture, suggesting significant underreporting, under-ascertainment, or
asymptomatic infection across multiple locations in Europe and North America. Many uncertainties and sources of
bias remain in interpreting these preliminary results. Clinically validated laboratory assays for detection of
antibodies are still largely lacking and therefore these results need to be interpreted with caution. In addition,
specimens from blood donors are from healthy adults, and will necessarily exclude people with symptomatic
respiratory or febrile illness. With levels of prevalence in the range of 2-3%, the expected positive predictive value
of such test is in the range of 20%, therefore the reported proportions are to be seen as significant overestimates
of population prevalence.

Pharmaceutical prophylaxis and treatment
At present, no medicine has demonstrated efficacy in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Potential treatments
should be carefully assessed in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). There are several large-scale, multicentre trials
underway that use appropriately robust methodology for assessment of potential therapeutics, including the WHO
Solidarity Trial, several United States National Institutes of Health and national trials in several EU Member States
[132,133]. Enrolment of patients in clinical trials should be encouraged. The European Medicines Agency has published
recommendations on compassionate use of the investigational antiviral agent remdesivir [134].
Two encouraging reports of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CP) use in China [135-138] concur with ongoing
activities, mainly in the US and the EU, on the collection, qualification, therapeutic use and data collection of
COVID-19 CP [135-138].

3. ECDC risk assessment
Many uncertainties remain regarding the level of individual and population immunity, age-stratified risk factors for
severe illness, the effectiveness of treatment regimens, and the impact and duration of individual or community level
physical distancing preventive measures implemented at different points in time and with different intensity across
countries.
This assessment is based on information available to ECDC at the time of publication and unless otherwise stated, the
assessment of risk refers to the risk that existed at the time of writing. It follows the ECDC rapid risk assessment
methodology, with relevant adaptations. The overall risk is determined by a combination of risk of the probability
of an event occurring and of its consequences (impact) to individuals or the population [139].
Risk assessment questions
 What is the risk, as of 22 April 2020, of severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2infection in the general
population in the EU/EEA and UK?
 What is the risk, as of 22 April 2020, of severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in populations
with defined factors associated with elevated risk for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK?
 What is the risk of resurgence of sustained community transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming
weeks, as a consequence of phasing out ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjusting community level physical
distancing measures without appropriate systems and capacities in place?
What is the risk, as of 22 April 2020, of severe disease associated
with SARS-CoV-2infection in the general population in the EU/EEA
and UK?
 The risk of severe disease in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered low for the general population in
areas where appropriate physical distancing measures are in place and/or where community transmission
has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels.
 The risk of severe disease in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered moderate for the general
population in areas where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place and/or where
community transmission is still high and ongoing.
This assessment is based on the following factors:
 Most EU/EEA countries have observed decreases in the daily number of newly reported cases in the last two
weeks. As of 22 April, 20 countries had decreasing 14-day incidence, with 19 countries reporting a current 14-
day incidence below 50 cases per 100 000 population. Although the composition and intensity of
implementation vary, all EU/EEA countries and the UK have introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical
interventions such as ‘stay-at-home’ policies (recommended or enforced) alongside other community and
physical distancing measures such as the cancellation of mass gatherings and closure of educational
institutions and public spaces to reduce transmission. While uncertainty remains about the extent to which the
combination and intensity of these measures impacts on transmission, in several countries such measures are
associated, at least temporarily, with decreases in the number of newly reported cases at population level. In
addition, transmission rates within countries are heterogeneous and even in countries with high incidence of
COVID-19, there are areas where sustained community transmission has been halted or strongly reduced. In
countries with appropriate measures in place as well, as in areas where transmission has declined or remained
low, the probability of infection with COVID-19 is currently assessed as low.
 However, several countries appear to have not yet reached a peak and the current 14-day incidence is
currently the highest observed. As of 22 April, five countries, including Spain, that show a clear decreasing
trend still have a 14-day incidence >100 cases per 100 000 population. In these countries, the implemented
control measures may not yet be showing the desired effect. In these settings, the probability of infection with
COVID-19 is currently assessed as very high.
 The analysis of data from TESSy shows that the risk of hospitalisation increases rapidly with age already from
the age of 30, and that the risk of death increases from the age of 50, although the majority of
hospitalisations and deaths are among the very oldest age groups. Older males are particularly affected, being
more likely than females of the same age to be hospitalised, require ICU/respiratory support, or die. All-cause
excess mortality from EuroMOMO, particularly at this time when competing drivers (influenza and high/low
temperatures) are largely absent, shows considerable excess mortality in multiple countries, affecting both the
15-64 and 65+ years age groups in the pooled analysis. Once infected, no specific treatment for COVID-19
exists, however early supportive therapy, if healthcare capacity for this exists, can improve outcomes. In summary,
the impact of severe disease of COVID-19, if acquired, is assessed as moderate for the general population.
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020
15
What is the risk, as of 22 April 2020, of severe disease associated
with SARS-CoV-2 infection in populations with defined factors
associated with elevated risk for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK?
 The risk of severe disease in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered moderate for populations with
defined factors associated with elevated risk for COVID-19 in areas where appropriate physical distancing
measures are in place and/or where community transmission has been reduced or maintained at low levels.
 The risk of severe disease in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered very high for populations with
defined factors associated with elevated risk for COVID-19 in areas where appropriate physical distancing
measures are not in place and/or where community transmission is still high and ongoing.
This assessment is based on the following factors:
 The probability of infection in the different areas has been assessed above and is the same for populations
with defined factors associated with elevated risk for COVID-19 (low to very high depending on the
implementation of appropriate physical distancing measures and the level of community transmission). The
probability of infection is particularly high for individuals in closed settings such as LTCFs due to the potential
for rapid spread associated with incorrectly applied IPC measures and/or lack of PPE.
 The analysis of TESSy data shows that persons over 65 years of age and/or people with underlying health
conditions, when infected with SARS-CoV-2, are at increased risk of severe illness and death compared with
younger individuals. These vulnerable populations account for the majority of severe disease and fatalities to
date. Older males are particularly affected, being more likely than females of the same age to be hospitalised,
require ICU/respiratory support, or die. Long term care facilities which are home to frail elderly people with
underlying conditions, have had a large impact on the overall reported mortality in many EU/EEA countries
and the UK. A rapid spread of the disease in these facilities has been observed causing high morbidity in the
residents and staff as well as high mortality in the elderly residents. The number of fatal cases from LTCFs
contribute substantially to the overall reported COVID-19 mortality in countries, in some cases by more than
60%. Although strict physical distancing measures, hand hygiene and use of face masks together with closing
these facilities for visitors minimises the risk of disease introduction, the high proportion of asymptomatic
cases among staff, staff working in several facilities, lack of PPE and other essential medical supplies as well as
lack of training of staff have contributed to the spread of the disease. In summary, the impact of COVID-19 is
assessed as very high for elderly and individuals with defined risk factors.
What is the risk of resurgence of sustained community transmission
in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks, as a consequence of
phasing out ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjusting community level
physical distancing measures without appropriate systems and
capacities in place?
 The risk of resurgence of sustained community transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK is currently
moderate if measures are phased out gradually and accompanied by appropriate monitoring systems
and capacities, with the option to reintroduce measures if needed, and remains very high if measures
are phased out without appropriate systems and capacities in place, with a likely rapid increase in
population morbidity and mortality.
This assessment is based on the following factors:
 The effect of testing strategies, healthcare capacities and environmental conditions has not been fully
disentangled when evaluating the role played by the community and physical distancing measures
implemented in different EU/EEA countries and the UK. However, the temporal relationship between
application of such measures and changes in morbidity and mortality rates, and the results of modelling
studies, suggest that it is very likely that those measures, and particularly the ‘stay-at-home’ policies, have
played an important role in reducing transmission and, in some subnational areas, have led to a strong
reduction in the rate of disease incidence and mortality. The available information from the first sero-
epidemiological studies indicates the population immunity is still low (in most cases <10%). Phasing out
measures may cause a rapid resurgence of transmission unless:
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020
16
 measures are phased out after a clear indication that the spread of the disease has substantially
decreased for a sustained period of time and health system capacities have fully recovered;
 a robust surveillance strategy, extended testing capacities, and a robust framework for contact
tracing are in place.
 clear strategies are in place for adjusting community level physical distancing measures in a way that
allows their effectiveness to be evaluated, taking into account local differences in transmission rates,
and being ready to refine and re-implement measures based on the evolution of transmission
patterns.
 In the absence of a vaccine or an effective treatment and because of the still low population immunity level,
rapid resurgence of sustained community transmission may occur, which can lead to very high population
morbidity and mortality. This can be directly related to disruption of healthcare services, as happened in March
2020 in several EU/EEA countries and the UK, but also to the high mortality associated with outbreaks in
LTCFs residents and in other populations with defined factors associated with elevated risk for severe COVID-
19, if these are not appropriately shielded. In summary, the impact could be very high, not only from a public
health perspective, but also because COVID-19 outbreaks can cause huge economic and societal disruptions.

4. Considerations when planning for
adjusting ‘stay-at-home’ policies and
physical distancing measures
The epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA and the UK varies by region and country, but an analysis of the
epidemic progression indicates that, before the introduction of community-level physical distancing measures, all
countries followed a similar epidemic curve with a few weeks’ lag-time between countries/regions (Annex 3). To
date, most countries are still experiencing widespread sustained transmission and, following large-scale
interventions, a few countries are transitioning to or have reached a situation where transmission is reduced to
localised clusters. The five scenarios describing the possible progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in EU/EEA
countries were described in ECDC’s fifth Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19 [140].
As the transmission of COVID-19 increased, EU/EEA countries and the UK progressively implemented a variety of
measures. An overview showing the daily incidence of reported COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population and daily
reported deaths per 1 000 000 population, both with a 7-day moving average, and the main public health response
measures at national level reported from public sources over time is presented in Annex 5 (figure 4A). As of
Monday 20 April 2020, all 31 EU/EEA countries and the UK had a measure in place to cancel mass gatherings
(31/31, 100%). This includes the cancellation of specific events or a ban on gatherings of a particular size. Generic
measures to close public spaces are currently ongoing in 30 countries (30/31, 97%) and include the closure of
cafes or restaurants, non-essentials shops, various entertainment venues and the partial or full closure of public
transport. Most EU/EEA countries and the UK also had measures in place to close educational institutions including
the closure of secondary schools or higher education (31/31, 100%), the closure of primary schools (28/31, 90%)
and the closure of daycare or nursery schools (23/31, 74%). Enforced or recommended ‘stay-at-home’ policies for
the general population (also reported in some countries as ‘lockdown’) are currently in place in more than half of
EU/EEA countries and the UK (17/31, 55%). Eighteen countries have ‘stay-at-home’ recommendations for risk
groups (18/31, 58%).
Such measures are highly disruptive to society, both economically and socially, and there is therefore significant
interest in defining a sound approach to phase out ‘stay-at-home’ policies and to adjust community and physical
distancing measures. Following reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases and/or deaths, several Member States
have started to ease measures such as re-opening primary schools and kindergartens (e.g. Denmark, Czech
Republic, Norway) and small retail shops, hairdressers, and independent shops (e.g. Austria, Germany, Italy)
(Annex 5; figure 4B).
Lifting too many measures at once without appropriate systems and capacities in place may however cause a rapid
resurgence of transmission. The question is therefore how Member States can restart economic and social activities
while minimising the impact of COVID-19 on citizen’s health and healthcare systems. The Joint European Roadmap
towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures addresses this question by providing the framework for a
comprehensive economic and social recovery plan for the EU, with public health actions at its core [141].
In the current situation, measures in Member States should continue to be aimed at the containment and
mitigation of further transmission of the virus, and its impact, including infection prevention and control,
community-level physical distancing, measures in hospital settings, surveillance and testing. A focus on vulnerable
groups and populations with defined risk criteria is paramount.
General considerations
The reduction in the rate of incident reported cases in many EU/EEA Member States is almost certainly due to the
introduction of stringent control measures. A modelling study of Île-de-France, France estimated that entering
‘lockdown’ had reduced the effective reproduction number from 3.0 to 0.68 [142], and a similar study in Vo’, Italy
estimated a reduction from 3.0 to 0.24 [31]. Modelling studies show that lifting interventions too rapidly will cause
a sudden upsurge in case incidence. However, a progressive strategy to phase out measures, where an increasing
proportion of the population returns to work, could mitigate the risk of significant upsurges, and maintain incidence
at a rate within hospital capacity [143,144] and allow monitoring systems to identify the need for re-introduction of
specific measures if there is a sharp resurgence.
The relative effectiveness of different measures is, as yet, still unclear since many countries around the world
introduced interventions en bloc. The estimation of effectiveness of interventions at reducing transmission and at
reducing morbidity and mortality remains a research priority.
Nonetheless, the considered refinement of control measures may help mitigate the negative impact on society and
the economy, while continuing to protect the health of those most at risk of developing severe disease. Some
measures e.g. universal restrictions on movement, may be more effective at reducing transmission in the
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020
18
community as a whole, whereas others, e.g. restrictions on visiting nursing homes, may have a disproportionate
effect on reducing morbidity and mortality. However, a study of the burden of COVID-19 estimates that 31% of
the European population is at elevated risk of developing severe disease due to the underlying prevalence of
chronic diseases [145]. Therefore, even targeted interventions may come at a high societal cost. As the stringency
of physical distancing measures is reduced, members of the public should be encouraged to carefully consider with
whom they come into contact. Consistently meeting with the same colleagues and small group of friends will lead
to lower rates of transmission than meeting with a diverse and changing group. The promotion of ‘micro-
communities’ will allow for work to be conducted and for social interaction to promote wellbeing, while still limiting
the spread of infection [146].
In summary, if control measures are to be lifted, conscious efforts to protect the vulnerable and careful choices by
all in their interactions with others will help to moderate the increased risk of transmission.
Public health objectives
While phasing out of the ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjusting community and physical distancing measures, the
EU/EEA actions should support the following public health objectives:
 Reduce morbidity, severe disease and mortality in the population through proportionate non-medical
countermeasures, with emphasis on protecting vulnerable (high-risk) groups, until effective vaccines,
treatments and medicines become available.
 Limit and control virus circulation and transmission in the general population now (flattening the curve) and
for the months to come to maintain the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections at manageable levels for the
healthcare system, possibly allowing for gradual acquisition of population immunity.
 Understand the public health effectiveness of specific measures while also identifying the best measures
that are sustainable long-term during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This will enable countries to avoid
future re-implementation of measures that have little or no impact on virus transmission, or are overly-
burdensome on societal wellbeing.
 Minimise the indirect effects that the current healthcare response to COVID-19 may have on other diseases.
For example, the increased risk of depression and other mental health conditions, the increased risk of
limited access to lifesaving treatments for acute medical conditions, and the increased risk of suboptimal
clinical management or screening for chronic medical conditions.
 Restart activities while minimising any impact on people's health and the healthcare system in a coordinated
fashion within countries and between EU/EEA Member States.
To reach these public health objectives, when planning to phase out the ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjust
community and physical distancing measures, all EU/EEA and the UK should give consideration to having in place
criteria, indicators, monitoring systems and accompanying measures, as described below:
 A robust surveillance strategy based on enhanced testing , which thoroughly and continuously monitors
the epidemic by gathering comparable data among Member States, monitors the intensity and geographical
spread, detects nosocomial outbreaks, identifies and monitors changes in risk groups, provides information
about age-specific population immunity, measures the impact on healthcare systems, monitors viral
changes and measures of the impact of mitigation and physical distancing measures (and their
adjustments) through appropriate epidemiological indicators and criteria. In the absence of solid data from
surveillance systems, it will difficult for countries to decide when it is possible for certain measures to be
modified/lifted. Some surveillance systems currently in use may not be sufficiently sensitive and accurate.
Therefore, decision-making on public health measures should not be based only on incidence data and
trends from current surveillance systems, but should be supported by additional data.
 A framework for contact tracing, based on extensive testing, active case finding, early detection of
cases, isolation of cases, quarantine and follow up of contacts, possibly supported by electronic tools and
applications.
 An expanded testing capacity and harmonised testing methodologies, for the purpose of
surveillance, detection of cases, clinical management, isolation, contact tracing, protecting risk groups and
assessing population immunity. This includes alignment of testing methodologies, development and ramping
up of sustained COVID-19 diagnostic capacity (including rapid tests), set-up of adequate testing schemes
and rollout of serological testing.
 Sufficient health system capacity and resilience including recovered general capacity (not related
COVID-19), hospital and ICU beds. Other considerations are IPC measures (for HCW and for reducing
transmission in hospital settings), stocks of pharmaceutical products, PPE and other equipment, care for
vulnerable groups, primary care structures, staff with appropriate skills to care for patients discharged from
hospitals/maintained at home and staff to engage in testing and contact tracing.
 A strong risk communication strategy to inform and engage the general public and vulnerable groups
explaining the rationale behind phasing out ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjustment of community measures.

A robust surveillance strategy
Phasing out of ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjusting the community level physical distancing measures need to be
underpinned by strong surveillance systems, which can provide timely data on the level of community circulation of
SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of existing surveillance systems may however be limited, particularly at sub-national
level. Additional sources of data should therefore be considered to inform public health decisions such as those
described in Table 4. These key epidemiological indicators should be monitored continuously in order to allow
Member States to rapidly take action if lifting/easing of specific measures results in increased transmission and
burden on healthcare systems, both at the national and the sub-national level. The main surveillance objectives
include monitoring of the intensity and geographical spread, detect nosocomial outbreaks, identify and monitor
changes in risk groups, measure the impact on healthcare systems, measure the impact of mitigation measures
and monitor viral changes. These objectives and the surveillance approaches needed are described in the
document ‘Strategies for the surveillance of COVID-19’ [147].
Member States should aim to collect comparable data by using common case definitions and surveillance
approaches as much as possible, although it is clear that the restrictions currently in place in many countries mean
that there are significant challenges in using existing influenza surveillance systems for COVID-19 monitoring.
Member States should take every opportunity to enhance existing surveillance systems, in particular if cases are on
a downward trajectory and public health resources become increasingly available. There should be a focus on
establishing and/or strengthening sentinel outpatients, hospital-based surveillance (in particular severe acute
respiratory infections (SARI) and ICU surveillance) and LTCF and mortality surveillance, in preparation for eventual
second waves of infection.
Syndromic surveillance and sentinel virological surveillance
In countries where sentinel outpatients or similar surveillance systems continue to function, data on the prevalence
of influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infections (ARI) in the community can be important indicators of
the circulation of the virus in the population, and can be a way of monitoring the effectiveness of control measures
and the situation once physical distancing measures are lifted. Syndromic surveillance based on telephone
consultations, telephone calls to specific COVID-19 helplines or mobile phone applications can also be used in
similar ways. Sensitivity of these systems in detecting increasing circulation may however be limited at sub-national
level when the population coverage is small.
Virological surveillance implemented as part of the systems described above will provide more specific information
on the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, although asymptomatic infections will likely not be captured.
Hospital-based surveillance
Key indicators which can inform the lifting (or reimplementation) of physical distancing measures are those
obtained from hospital-based surveillance. Such indicators could include the number and proportion of SARI
patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 in all hospital wards and/or in intensive care units. Enhanced surveillance of SARI
patients or, if resources do not allow, enhanced surveillance of hospitalised-confirmed COVID-19 cases in all wards
or those in ICU can provide additional data on risk factors and allow for rapid identification of changes and
implementation of specific control measures. The capacity in hospitals and specifically in intensive care units also
needs to be monitored and physical distancing measures should not be lifted if the healthcare system is operating
at full capacity.
Long-term care facilities
A significant proportion of deaths in the current epidemic have occurred among elderly in LTCF. Surveillance in
these settings is therefore essential, and should be strengthened, when physical distancing measures start to be
lifted. Rapid identification of suspected cases is essential in order to quickly control outbreaks and reduce mortality.
Daily monitoring of symptoms in all residents and staff within these settings is crucial to initiate early testing and
identify cases. Suspected cases should be reported to local public health authorities for the implementation of
outbreak control measures and national authorities should also receive a minimum aggregated data set on the
number of affected facilities. Due to the relatively high proportion (around 15%) of asymptomatic cases that have
been observed among residents and staff in such settings [55,61] and considering the severe outcome for
residents, a comprehensive testing strategy should be considered when a first case is identified. The policy has to
be adapted to local capacities and the epidemiological situation in the community. The early identification of cases
will support control efforts and allow outbreak response measures, e.g. to cohort residents accordingly. Staff in
long-term care facilities should also be tested on a regular basis, for example twice weekly in order to further
reduce the risk of introduction and spread of infection. Where capacity for comprehensive testing is not available,
probable cases and deaths (i.e. among patients with clinically compatible symptoms but lacking laboratory
confirmation) should be included in surveillance data to provide a more comprehensive picture of the situation.
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020

Mortality reporting
Collection of data on the number of COVID-19 related deaths is essential and the trend in the number of deaths is
an important (albeit delayed) indicator when considering phasing out of physical distancing measures. A large
number of deaths may occur outside hospital and in long-term care facilities. Surveillance systems should be able
to include the number of deaths from these facilities and testing capacity should be available for confirmation of
suspected cases in such settings, for surveillance and IPC purposes.
WHO have recently published guidance on certification and classification of COVID-19 related deaths [148]. ECDC
endorses this guidance, which for surveillance purposes defines a death due to COVID-19 as a death resulting from
a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause
of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete
recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due to COVID-19 may not be attributed to another
disease (e.g. cancer) and should be counted independently of pre-existing conditions that are suspected of
triggering a severe course of COVID-19.
Use of this definition and inclusion of deaths among probable cases will provide a more complete assessment of
the impact of the pandemic and allow for more comparable data across Member States.
Apart from monitoring trends in the number of probable and confirmed deaths, countries should urgently improve
the timeliness, geographic resolution and age-group resolution of all-cause or specific excess mortality, which is
likely to become the most sensitive indicator of COVID-19 mortality in coming weeks. This is essential to more
comprehensively assess the impact of the pandemic and identify the most affected age groups in a timely manner.
Additional studies
Member States should consider specific studies to supplement surveillance data in order to have a more
comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community [31,92,149]. Such
studies, particularly if repeated regularly, can provide information on the effectiveness of ‘stay-at-home’ policies
and community level physical distancing measures and the timing of their lifting. An approach with pooling of
clinical samples for RT-PCR testing on a random population sample, could allow for a relatively rapid assessment of
the prevalence in the community, particularly at subnational level, and also give an indication of the proportion of
asymptomatic cases [150-152]. Age-stratified seroepidemiological population-wide surveys can estimate population
immunity and the speed of development of immunity during community outbreaks, providing key information to
guide decisions on de-escalation strategies. A protocol from WHO is available [153].
Considerations for epidemiological criteria and indicators to plan and
monitor the adjustment of community level physical distancing
measures
When planning and deciding to adjust community level physical distancing measures, the following criteria and
approaches could be considered:
 Start monitoring epidemiological indicators before the planned change to create a baseline (at least two
weeks is recommended) and when measures are adjusted differentially at a sub-national level, establish
monitoring information at subnational level.
 Start adjusting measures (if conditions allow, one at a time), in smaller or localised geographical areas, in
order to minimise the impact, should the lifting/easing of that measure result in a significant surge of cases.
 Allow sufficient time after lifting/easing one measure to evaluate its impact on virus circulation and on
consequent COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality (evidence to-date indicates that the impact of
adjusting measures may take at least two to four weeks to become apparent in epidemiological monitoring
systems).
 When deciding which measures can be lifted first, choose those measures targeted to specific age groups
where evidence shows continued limited disease transmission is less likely to result in major public health
impact. So far, this may apply only to children younger than 10 years of age (who are not also members of
high-risk groups), although there are still limited data on the role of children in transmitting the disease
[31,149].
 When adjusting physical distancing measures, identify measures that could be maintained for longer periods
of time with some adjustments; consider for example allowing people to leave home but keeping a two
meter distance from one another, opening activities where physical distance can be guaranteed, allowing
access to open spaces where people can easily keep distance from outdoor activities and access to open or
indoor spaces where people can easily keep distance from one another, or those measures with little
societal impact (e.g. teleworking).
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020
21
For these approaches to be successful, it is necessary that they are accompanied by a thorough and continuous
monitoring of the epidemiological situation following the adjustment of a measure. Enhanced monitoring should
take place at the lowest geographical level possible corresponding to the area where a given measure is modified.
Such ad hoc systems overcome the lack of sensitivity of existing sentinel surveillance systems, and ensures that
upsurge of cases following the lift of a measure are detected in a timely manner in different settings. These also
provide data on the effectiveness of various measures thus allowing the further optimisation of the public health
response.
Regardless of the measures modified, people at risk of severe clinical outcomes from contracting COVID-19 must
remain protected from infection, irrespective of age and occupation, until an effective vaccine or treatment is
available.
All indirect consequences of lifting measures should be assessed prior to their modification, such as effects on
public transportation usage and other crowding of public spaces where high rates of viral transmission may occur,
or specific mixing patterns such as between children and elderly individuals.
Prior to modifying measures, each country should have appropriate and adequate testing of COVID-19
implemented that is capable of detecting and closely monitoring changes in disease transmission at the population
level to over a longer time and within and between communities. All suspected cases should be included in the
monitoring system, and all cases or a proportion of them, possibly identified through random selection, should be
tested for COVID-19.
In the absence of reliable and representative data from surveillance systems it will be difficult for countries to
decide when it is possible for certain measures to be adjusted. Some surveillance systems currently in use may not
be sufficiently sensitive and accurate. Therefore, decision-making on public health measures should not be based
only on incidence data and trends from current surveillance systems, but should be supported by additional data
such as those described in Table 4. In order to decide when it is safe to modify the current set of public health
measures and to ensure sufficient capacity for monitoring the effect of changing such measures, ECDC
recommends establishing ad hoc national or regional data collection in different settings from various sources.
Suggested data sources, methods, and indicators to guide decision-making in Member States are described in
Table 4. There should be clear policies on what actions should be taken if or when the trend for an indicator is
observed to rise or fall following the adjustment of a measure. These might include, in the case of an adverse
trend, reinforcing other measures, reintroducing the modified/lifted measures, or consideration of changing/lifting
a different measure; whereas, in the case of a positive trend, these might include continuation with the adjusted
measure and adjustment (easing) of another measure after a suitable period of time.

Testing capacity and methodologies
A pivotal criterion of the Joint European Roadmap towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures is to ensure
appropriate monitoring capacity, including large-scale testing to detect cases and monitor the spread of the virus
combined with contact tracing and isolation measures to slow down transmission [141]. Expanding capacities for
large-scale community testing will enable more effective contact tracing around cases and identify asymptomatic
infections as a potential source of transmission in high-risk settings such as long-term care facilities for the elderly
and other closed institutions. Timely and accurate virus detection testing is an essential element of the response,
supporting decisions on infection control strategies and patient management at healthcare facilities. EU and WHO
guidance on testing strategies should be followed [154]. Capacity at scale needs to be ensured before Member
States begin lifting physical distancing measures. Enhanced testing should therefore ensure sufficient resources for
setting up and maintaining real-time surveillance and alert systems to monitor and control community transmission
of COVID-19 during gradual de-escalation of measures as described above.
As part of the Joint European Roadmap, the European Commission has issued Guidelines on COVID-19 in vitro
diagnostic tests and their performance [154]. These guidelines assess both what information different types of
tests can deliver for medical and public health decision making and how to validate that the test performance is fit
for purpose. To foster scaling up of the testing capacity and ensure adequate quality of tests across the EU, the
Commission will undertake a number of actions including:
 an assessment of common approaches in national testing strategies
 the discussion of best practices and development of guidance on performance evaluation and conformity
assessment of tests
 the provision of reference materials and common methods for the comparison of devices
 the sharing of information on the performance of tests
 additional dialogue with industry and national competent authorities
 support in the fight against counterfeit devices
 coordination of supply and demand
 ensuring the fair distribution of laboratory supplies between Member States.
In this context, ECDC will continue to contribute to capacity building and test validation efforts by mobilising the
knowledge and experience from Member States within the European networks of public health experts and
reference laboratories. ECDC coordinates a COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 network which includes laboratory experts and
discusses key laboratory aspects on a regular basis within the network. In close collaboration with WHO and WHO
referral laboratories, ECDC is organising external quality assessment exercises and facilitating exchange of
information on test performance between Member States’ public health laboratories from the COVID-19 laboratory
network.
Despite shortages of consumables in the past weeks, testing capacity for virus detection is rapidly expanding in
EU/EEA countries by the roll out of PCR-based diagnostics from central public health laboratories to regional and
local diagnostic laboratories and the use of high-throughput automated molecular testing platforms. However,
additional capacity for much larger scale testing with rapid commercial tests, once such tests are validated to have
adequate performance for infection detection, will most likely be necessary to fully meet the operational needs for
COVID-19 control in the forthcoming weeks and months.
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020
24
Sufficient capacity for various testing strategies during the different phases of the outbreak is paramount. In
situations where testing capacities are sufficient, all patients presenting to the healthcare system with symptoms of
ARI should be considered as suspected cases according to the EU case definition and should be tested for SARS-
CoV-2 virus as part of active case finding [155]. Testing of asymptomatic contacts may be considered depending
on the availability of resources, especially in healthcare settings and LTCFs, to identify potential sources of
infection and protect vulnerable individuals. A sample pooling approach for low-risk asymptomatic contacts may be
considered after thorough validation in the laboratory. If the number of suspected cases exceeds the available
testing capacity in a country or an area, testing of the groups should be prioritised according to the criteria
described in the eighth update of the risk assessment and ECDC strategies for the surveillance of COVID-19
[85,147].
Member States should adapt these recommendations based on the national/local epidemiological situation and
their resources, ensuring that testing also covers surveillance needs. Part of the testing capacity should be
preserved for point prevalence and seroepidemiological studies for surveillance purposes.
Test types and validation
Assay types and performance criteria
The Commission has produced a working document which proposes a tentative definition of COVID-19 diagnostic
test performance criteria and has reviewed publically available data on the performance of CE-marked commercial
IVD tests as of 6 April 2020 (current performance of COVID-19 test methods and devices and proposed
performance criteria [156]). For SARS-CoV-2 detection, the authors recommended using in-house RT-PCR tests
that follow one of the WHO recommended protocols. The review has identified 78 CE-marked RNA detection tests
that claimed good performance based on data reported by the manufacturers but could not be linked to scientific
study reports as the viral RNA sequences detected by the test are not disclosed. This restriction of information will
limit the ability in the future to detect SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants that may decrease sensitivity of these PCR
assays based on genomic sequence analysis. WHO, through the Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL), have
shortlisted three molecular detection assays and FIND has provided validation results for five different ones
[157,158]. The report concluded that 13 antigen detection tests are CE-marked but that information on their
performance in the scientific literature is scarce. For serology, the review identified 101 CE-marked antibody
devices. Good levels of sensitivity and specificity are claimed for these tests but are not validated by third parties.
The report concluded that that currently available evidence on the reliability and comparability of most COVID-19
tests is limited and has to be expanded as soon as possible to ensure that these tests demonstrate suitability for
their intended use. Once validated, commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests will be essential for performing large-
scale seroepidemiological population surveys and for assessing the immune status of first-line responders and
healthcare personnel and for guiding IPC measures. However, it is too early to use antibody tests to find who is
protected against the disease. There is insufficient evidence about the immunity acquired against the virus after
infection and how well an antibody test can predict protection from re-infection. The detected antibodies do not
directly mean that the person has acquired protective immunity against the disease or the infection and we have
to further learn how long this immunity will last. WHO has provided several different types of protocols to study
immune response in the population and in targeted groups [159]. Research groups have developed and are
validating both in-house and commercial antibody detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 [156]. Preliminary reports on
ELISA assays have shown good correlation of antibody titration results with virus-neutralising antibodies [116,160].
When reliable rapid antigen tests are identified, they may be considered for the rapid diagnosis of infected
patients. However, these tests tend to have lower sensitivity than RT-PCR, and therefore a negative rapid test may
not be able to rule out infection. They may be useful during an ongoing outbreak, when timely access to sensitive
molecular testing is unavailable, but a negative result should be interpreted by a healthcare professional with
caution and based on clinical judgement.
Self-sampling and self-testing
Self-sampling approaches, while symptomatic people continue to self-isolate, may provide an efficient way to
screen patients for COVID-19 on a large-scale basis, while reducing the risk of contaminating workers at healthcare
facilities and decreasing the risk of non-infected people becoming infected in waiting rooms. To date, there are no
validated self-testing or community-based testing SARS-CoV-2 assays available. Some EU countries — including
Belgium, Finland, Sweden, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands — have warned against or even banned self-
tests for coronavirus at this stage.
Sequencing
Representative viruses from different geographic locations, time of occurrence during the epidemic, age, gender
and severity should be selected for RNA sequencing to monitor the virus evolution and changes in the virus
genome. RT-PCR with a Ct value less than 30 is considered a good source of sequencing material.
RAPID RISK ASSESSMENT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK – ninth update, 23 April 2020
25
Countries that do not have sequencing capacity through their national laboratories are encouraged to send
specimens to referral laboratories or request sequencing support from ECDC (please send an email to
typing@ecdc.europa.eu with your request). The viral sequences should be deposited in GISAID. ECDC can support
countries with raw whole genome sequence analysis if needed.
Test validation
The European Commission has published guidance on current performance of COVID-19 test methods and devices
and proposed performance criteria with the most critical performance parameters being diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity [156]. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests and serological assays for COVID-19 in well-
designed clinical trials is still missing and essential to perform before introducing them into the routine as a stand-
alone test [156,161]. In addition, it is important to be vigilant about fraudulent commercial claims of test
performance, as communicated by WHO in a Medical Product Alert on 31 March 2020 in relation to reports of
falsified in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) and laboratory reagents for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 [162]. ECDC is working
closely with the European Commission, Member State authorities and national laboratories, FIND and WHO to help
monitor the ongoing validation of these rapid tests.
FIND is performing validation studies and the results are published at https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/dx-data/. In
addition, such studies are also being performed by WHO referral laboratories for COVID-19, and the European
Commission and Member States are funding fast-track clinical validation studies of rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19.
Scientific publications of results should soon clarify the clinical performance and limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and
indicate which tests can be used safely and reliably for specific medical or public health purposes.
A framework for contact tracing
Contact tracing is an effective and essential public health measure for the control of COVID-19. The aim is to
promptly identify and manage contacts of COVID-19 cases in order to reduce further onward transmission. The
Joint European Roadmap highlights the importance of countries having a robust contact tracing system in place in
conjunction with access to widespread testing and strengthened healthcare systems ahead of the lifting of any
physical distancing measure [141]. Close collaboration and coordination between Member States around contact
tracing will further be important as borders re-open to ensure effective cross-border control of virus transmission.
The key elements of contact tracing are outlined in detail in the recent ECDC guidance [163]. These include:
contact identification, to identify persons who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 after contact with an
infected person; contact listing, to trace and communicate with the identified contacts, and to provide
information about suitable infection control measures, symptom monitoring and other precautionary measures
such as the need for quarantine and contact follow-up to monitor these contacts for symptoms.
Existing evidence related to the current COVID-19 outbreak has shown the importance of contact tracing both as a
method of containment of the virus and as an effective tool in the context of widespread transmission [82,164-
167]. A recent ECDC mapping of contact tracing activities across EU/EEA Member States and the UK found that all
countries surveyed reported having public health structures in place to support contact tracing and most countries
had maintained contact tracing efforts during the mitigation phase (often scaling back the intensity of activities). A
few countries paused contact tracing temporarily as the number of cases escalated but reported that they were
planning to re-establish contact tracing prior to the lifting of any physical distancing measures. As part of the
easing strategies several countries reported plans to scale up their traditional contact tracing approach through the
use of different innovative methods. These include the use of supportive technology including mobile phone apps
and specific IT software, re-purposing existing resources such as call centres to support activities, and adapting
existing systems to reduce the intensity of follow-up activities where appropriate or undertaking these activities
using automated methods.
In addition to innovative methods to conduct contact tracing, to prepare for re-starting or scaling up contact
tracing, countries should undertake a review of the experiences gained from contract tracing for COVID-19 with
regards to the overall structure and processes of the local system, staffing time and information management
flows. Based on such an assessment, alongside an understanding of the local epidemiological situation, countries
will be better placed to identify what will be needed to scale up current operations to a sufficient level. This may
include the training of non-public health staff such as staff from other areas of public service or volunteers. Such
staff can work in call-centre like settings, supervised by public health staff. As further support, ECDC will also
publish an updated guide on the staffing resources needed to scale up contact tracing which will include resources
on training.
Contact tracing management software have been cited by several countries as key to managing large operations.
The Go.Data tool, developed by WHO, is one example: the tool is freely available, along with an online training
provided upon free registration at OpenWHO, and operational guidance available for public health authorities upon
request.

Other options to enable scale-up include complementing regular contact tracing with a web-based tool where cases
can enter details of the people they have been in contact with, and where follow up is partially automated. Mobile
applications for contact tracing are being developed that use, for example, Bluetooth technology to track and alert
users who are in close proximity to each other. Should one user be diagnosed with COVID-19, the app helps
enable the notification of their contacts. This technology could complement, but not replace, regular contact
tracing, in particular as many populations, such as the elderly, may not have mobile phones and not everyone with
a phone will download such an app. It is key that public health authorities are in charge of the overall contact
tracing process including the development and roll-out of such technology. Mobile apps could be particularly key to
enable cross-border contact tracing as long as this is considered during the development of the apps. The
European Commission has produced guidance both on the development of these apps and on associated data
protection considerations [168,169].
As identified by several countries, further EU-level support in relation to contact tracing would include facilitating
the sharing of information and experiences among countries on procedures and good practices, working to ensure
that the use of mobile phone apps complements contact tracing in an optimal way, as well as facilitating the
exchange of communication and training materials. A community of practice for learning, innovating and
strengthening contact tracing implementation across EU/EEA countries would further support this need.
Health system capacity and resilience
Preparedness
In accordance with the Joint European Roadmap [141], preparedness activities should focus on strengthening
healthcare systems by applying lessons learned from the current crisis and planning for a potential resurgence in
COVID-19 cases.
Prior to lifting measures, protocols should be established to quickly (re)introduce measures, and these should be
accompanied by community engagement strategies supported by strong risk communication, particularly for
vulnerable groups. Sufficient health system capacity should be re-established, assessed and monitored with
reference not only to COVID-19 but more generally. Concerning COVID-19, special attention should be paid to ICU
equipment, including equipment for mechanical ventilation and oxygenation, PPE, pharmaceuticals, laboratory
supplies, and medical, laboratory and contact tracing the workforce. ECDC has developed COVID-19 specific
resource estimation guidelines on PPE needs in healthcare settings [170], and on contact tracing, quarantine and
monitoring activities [163,171]. The WHO has also developed forecasting tools and documents that highlight
priority medical supplies and the workforce necessary [172].
To support rebuilding of health system capacity, procurement procedures should be leveraged to acquire the
necessary medical and IPC supplies at short notice. These may include the EU Joint Procurement Agreement [173],
rescEU stockpile [174], and existing bilateral and regional agreements. Strategies and tools to reduce resource
needs should also be considered, examples include the rational use of PPE [175], applying approaches to optimise
IPC management (e.g. setting up dedicated testing stations outside of the healthcare facility, and cohorting
COVID-19 patients), and introducing contact tracing apps. Workforce capacity may be increased through
recruitment and training; this for instance would be possible by engaging volunteers from the community to
conduct contact tracing, or organising healthcare training for laid-off staff to support nursing homes and hospitals.
When looking to restart non-urgent health services, it is important to consider that staff having worked intensively
during the pandemic will require time-off to recuperate and thus this will impact the extent to which these health
services can re-open In healthcare settings, especially hospitals, surge capacity plans must remain active to cope
with the possibility of fluctuating numbers of cases as each layer of measures is lifted.
With the objective of optimising the public health response to COVID-19, after-action reviews (AARs) and in-action
reviews (IARs) could be considered. The latter may be viewed as a streamlined version of after-action reviews and
offer a structured approach for identifying best practices whilst still in the crisis, that could be scaled up or
identifying gaps that need to be addressed. This would subsequently help to efficiently re-orientate response
strategies where needed. Please refer to the ECDC Best Practice Recommendations for Conducting AARs [175,176]
and WHO Guidance for AAR [177] for further details on AAR methodology. An ECDC document on conducting
COVID-19 in-action reviews and after-action reviews, is under development.

Infection prevention and control in healthcare settings (including
long-term care facilities)
IPC practices are of critical importance in protecting the function of healthcare services and mitigating the impact
on vulnerable populations. Due to the likelihood of virus transmission by persons with few or no symptoms, LTCFs
and healthcare facilities in general, should ensure that physical distancing measures are implemented by staff,
visitors and patients, particularly in settings with widespread community transmission. The use of medical masks
by healthcare workers not taking care of COVID-19 patients for personal protection and source control can reduce
transmission within healthcare settings [178]. Some healthcare facilities require that all healthcare providers wear
a medical mask while at work. Standard precautions, and in particular meticulous hand hygiene, should be
emphasised.
LTCFs, nursing homes for the elderly and rehabilitation facilities, where a high number of fragile people of older
age and with underlying conditions are taken care of, are most at risk of COVID-19 outbreaks, with high morbidity
in staff and high morbidity and mortality in residents [54,56]. Increased awareness, monitoring efforts as well as
strict IPC have to be applied. Early separation, isolation and cohorting of suspected cases with COVID-19
compatible symptoms needs to take place as early as possible to avoid further spread within the facility. Local
health authorities need to be informed when suspected cases are identified. Initiation of laboratory testing of
residents as well as involved staff needs to be conducted to prevent further spread within the facility but also to
other facilities, where staff might also perform duties. In Belgium and the US, testing of residents and staff showed
a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes and a high prevalence of asymptomatic [179] cases among both, residents
and staff [55]. Therefore, comprehensive testing of all residents and staff needs to be considered for the
identification of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases when a first case is identified. The policy has to be adapted
to local capacities and the epidemiological situation in the community. The early identification of cases will support
control efforts and allow outbreaks response measures. Access to, and supply of PPE in affected premises need to
be reassessed and modified according to the outbreak situation. Stringent hand hygiene and infection control
measures including the use of facemasks are required to minimise the risk of introduction. Increased safety
measures when entering the facilities and being in contact with residents is key.
Measures to prevent transmission in healthcare facilities are an immediate priority in order to safeguard risk
groups; slow the demand for specialised healthcare, such as intensive care; protect healthcare workers; and
minimise the export of cases to other healthcare facilities and the community. Up to 10% of all cases in Italy [69],
(up to 20% in Lombardy [75]) and 20% in Spain were among healthcare workers [66]. It is probable that
nosocomial outbreaks are important amplifiers of the local outbreaks, and they disproportionately affect the elderly
and other vulnerable populations. For more guidance on IPC measures in healthcare settings, please refer to the
‘Measures for health care settings’ section of ECDC’s eighth update of the risk assessment [85], and ECDC’s
technical reports on IPC for the care of patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings [175], the technical report on
personal protective equipment (PPE) needs in healthcare settings [170], ECDC ‘Guidance for wearing and removing
personal protective equipment in healthcare settings for the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-
19’ [180,181] and WHO’s ‘Five Moments for Hand Hygiene’ approach before touching a patient [182].
Home care and isolation of cases
Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic, subclinical infection
and mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Patients with a mild clinical presentation (mainly fever, cough, headache
and malaise) will not initially require hospitalisation and may be safely managed in dedicated isolation facilities or
at home. Such an approach decreases the pressure to the healthcare system, as hospital beds are saved for severe
cases, whilst the majority of mild patients will spontaneously recover without complications. However, as clinical
signs and symptoms may worsen with progressive dyspnoea due to lower respiratory tract disease, patients
treated at home should be provided with clear instructions on where and how to seek medical assistance.
According to data from China, an estimated 10–15% of mild cases progress to severe, and 15–20% of severe
cases become critical [82]. Reports show that clinical deterioration can occur rapidly, often after a few days of mild
symptoms during the second week of illness [34,82,183,184]. Home care could also be considered for symptomatic
patients no longer requiring hospitalisation, or in the case of informed refusal of hospitalisation [185].
Guidance for the clinical care of severe cases is available from WHO [186] and from the CDC-USA [187]. IPC
measures for homecare are outlined in WHO [185] and ECDC guidance [188].

28
A strong risk communication strategy
With several EU/EEA countries currently engaged in phasing out of the ‘stay-at-home’ policies and adjusting some
COVID-19-related measures, risk communication efforts need to be updated accordingly. These efforts should
include timely and transparent information about the process, including why the changes can now be made and
what their practical implications are. The population needs to be informed about both the risks they may face as
physical distancing measures are lifted, and the responsibilities that they still have regarding the need to maintain
firm adherence to whatever remaining measures are authorised by their national authorities.
A key challenge in this is that the level of population immunity to COVID-19 in most Member States remains
uncertain, although it is currently believed to be low in most settings [189]. People therefore need to understand
that – as has already happened in some countries – even if the initial wave of infections is successfully managed,
new waves can still occur [189]. Ongoing vigilance by the whole population is therefore an absolute necessity, but
the authorities should also acknowledge the sacrifices that everyone has made so far.
Two over-arching risk communication messages could be considered during any phasing out strategy:
 ‘This is a marathon, not a sprint.’ People’s expectations about the pandemic’s duration and the effect it
will continue to have on their lives for the foreseeable future need to be managed. This is not going to end
anytime soon, and people need to prepare mentally for that.
 ‘We must not drop our guard.’ During the phasing out process, communities must be engaged and
motivated so that they can continue to maintain high standards of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette,
use face masks when sick2
, as well as implement any necessary physical distancing. This will help to protect
themselves and others. Health workers (who can never ‘drop their guard’ during the pandemic, and who
enjoy a high level of trust and respect within the community) could be used as the messengers for this
message.
Continuous monitoring of public perception of the measures is important as a means of assessing risk perception,
people’s understanding of the public health advice that is given, and the level of support (or lack of support) for
the measures. Risk communication messages need to be adapted accordingly. Existing or perceived barriers to
implement the measures should be addressed, as should any rumours and misinformation that are identified.
For those at the highest risk of serious illness – people living in long-term care facilities, those with pre-existing
health conditions, and elderly people living in the community – risk communication activities must acknowledge the
potentially severe emotional and practical difficulties that they will be facing over what will inevitably be an
extended period of ‘cocooning’. It is important that people in these vulnerable groups feel the solidarity of the rest
of the population as they remain in isolation. Support mechanisms also need to be strengthened for them in order
to ensure their continued access to essential services. Further, if they have symptoms compatible with COVID-19,
it is important that they understand the importance of seeking medical advice early, given the stronger possibility
of progression to severe disease [188]. For guidance in caring for a COVID-19 patient in the household and for
ending isolation please consult the relevant ECDC guidance [42,191].
Psychologists have proposed a number of strategies to promote people’s mental health while COVID-19 physical
distancing measures are being implemented. During any de-escalation phase, these strategies should be
communicated to people in vulnerable groups, as well as to their carers:
 Encourage people to maintain close social contact with friends, family and other networks via internet-
based communications systems, social media and phone . We may be in physical isolation, but we need not
feel alone.
 Maintain routines as a means of managing anxiety [194] , while accepting that some degree of anxiety is a
natural response to the current situation [195].
 Engage in physical activity, whether in their homes, alone or outside [196]. This is important both for
physical health and mental wellbeing.
 Prioritise quality sleep. Getting enough good sleep underpins every aspect of physical and mental health
[197].
 Be kind to ourselves, and to those around us [197].

5. Limitations
This assessment is undertaken based on information available to ECDC at the time of publication. There is
substantial uncertainty regarding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. There is limited epidemiological
and clinical information on the cases of COVID-19 identified so far (e.g. efficiency of different modes of
transmission, proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases, transmission during incubation and recovery period,
effectiveness of treatment regimes, risk factors for severe illness other than age, effective preventive measures).
Given these limitations, ECDC will revise the current risk assessment as soon as more information becomes available.

*The data on response measures in figure 4A and 4B are based on information available from official public sources as of Monday 20 April at 10:00 and may not capture measures being taken
by countries that are not reported on publicly available websites. The situation is evolving rapidly and this represents a snapshot of the measures that countries in the EU/EEA and the UK have
reported to date. The response measures displayed are national measures, reported on official public websites. Response measures collected include: mass gathering cancellations (for specific
events or a ban on gatherings of a particular size); closure of public spaces (including restaurants, entertainment venues, non-essential shops, partial or full closure of public transport etc.);
closure of educational institutions (including daycare or nursery, primary schools, and secondary schools and higher education); ‘stay-at-home’ recommendations for risk groups or vulnerable
populations (such as the elderly, people with underlying health conditions, physically disabled people etc.); stay-at-home recommendations for the general population (which are voluntary or
not enforced); and stay-at-home orders for the general population (these are enforced and also referred to as ‘lockdown’).
The data on response measures has several limitations. Firstly, there is substantial heterogeneity in physical distancing policies and their implementation between countries. For instance, the
level of enforcement of measures may vary between countries and there may be specific rules and exceptions to the measures, making interpretation of the data challenging. The measures
displayed in these figures are measures reported at national level and it should be noted that due to the evolution of the outbreak in certain regions, regional or local measures often preceded
national ones. The exact dates of introduction were often available from official sources but delays in their implementation may have occurred. Additionally, availability of public data from
official government sources varies among countries. For some countries, data are no longer available on official websites concerning measures that are no longer in force, which may result in
the data for more recent measures being more complete.
