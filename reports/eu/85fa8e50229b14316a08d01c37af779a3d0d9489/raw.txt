Contact tracing is a core public
health response to COVID-19.
Other measures include active
case finding or physical distancing.
In order to trace a contact, we first
need to define what a ‘contact’ is.
A close contact of a COVID-19 case is any person:
who had face-to-face contact with a
COVID-19 case within two metres for
more than 15 minutes
who was in a closed environment (household,
classroom, meeting room, hospital waiting
room, etc.) with a COVID-19 case for more
than 15 minutes
who was in an airplane within two seats of a
COVID-19 case or people who were in close
contact with the case during the flight; if the
case showed strong symptoms or moved
around the airplane, all passengers may be
‘close contacts’
who had physical contact with a
COVID-19 case
who had unprotected direct contact with
infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case
(for example by being coughed on)
who was providing care to a COVID-19 case,
or laboratory workers who were handling
specimens from a COVID-19 case without
proper personal protective equipment or
with a possible breach of such equipment.
