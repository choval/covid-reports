Checklist for hospitals preparing for the reception
and care of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients
February 2020
Scope of this document
This document supports the public health preparedness planning for hospitals with regard to novel coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).
This checklist is based on the current knowledge of the COVID-19 outbreak and the evidence available.
ECDC will update this checklist should new relevant information become available.
Target audience
Public health authorities and hospital administrators in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom.
Background
What is COVID-19?
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is a coronavirus. It is transmitted through large respiratory droplets
and direct contact; other modes of transmission (i.e. airborne and faeco-oral) have also been proposed.
The average incubation period is estimated at 5 to 6 days, ranging from 0 to 14 days [1]. There is currently no
specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-19.
More disease background information is available online (ECDC [2], WHO [3]) and in the last ECDC Rapid Risk
Assessment [4].
Checklist for hospital preparedness
This checklist has been developed to support hospital preparedness for the management of COVID-19 patients.
The elements described in the list may not be applicable to all hospitals and may need to be adapted to the
specific characteristics of the hospital, the individual national health system, legislation and community where the
hospital is located.
Elements to be assessed have been divided into the following areas:
 Establishment of a core team and key internal and external contact points
 Human, material and facility capacity
 Communication and data protection
 Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE), and waste management
 Triage, first contact and prioritisation
ECDC TECHNICAL REPORT Checklist for hospitals preparing for the reception and care of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients

 Patient placement, moving of the patients in the facility, and visitor access
 Environmental cleaning
For each area mentioned above, the elements or processes were identified and the items to be checked are listed
below.
A procedure for the self-auditing of compliance with this checklist should be considered.
Further information can be found in the ECDC Health emergency preparedness for imported cases of high
consequence infectious diseases [5], in the WHO Hospital emergency response checklist [6], and in the CDC
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hospital Preparedness Assessment Tool [7].

postpone elective hospitalisations or interventions) are in place and have been
communicated to all staff involved
 Procedures are in place for the cleaning of common areas and equipment that cannot
only be used by non-suspected or confirmed cases
Tele-triage  A tele-triage system to triage patients before they arrive at the hospital is in place:

 The population has been informed about the tele-triage services of the hospital
because they were informed about these services through several channels
First contact at the
hospital
 Signs and information displays at the entrance and in waiting rooms provide Q&As
about COVID-19, hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene

disposable paper tissues) are available for staff and patients
 Quick checks at entry points to the emergency room, triaging of suspected cases, and
severity assessment procedures are in place

Patient placement, moving of the patients in the facility, and
visitor access
Element/Process Items to check
Patient placement  The capacity of isolation beds and ICU beds in the hospital has been assessed

there is increased need) has been calculated
 Maximum number of patients that can be cohorted in isolation rooms and
number of potential isolation rooms has been calculated
 A plan is in place that indicates the criteria that would trigger the
transformation of normal rooms into isolation rooms and also the order in
which this process would be carried out; this includes a plan to re-allocate
patients, facilitate their rapid discharge as soon as their clinical status allows
for it, or treat patients at home

PPE, are familiar with protocols and new tasks that they may be assigned to them,
etc.
 Airborne infection isolation (AII) rooms have been tested and certified for their
effectiveness (within the timeframe indicated by local regulations)

they can be used in the isolation rooms when appropriate.
 Only a limited number of staff members is authorised to access the isolation rooms;
they have been trained accordingly. Staff members who have access to isolation
rooms are tracked and records are kept. A record of all staff members who have
access to isolation rooms is kept so that all staff movements can be tracked.
