Considerations for infection prevention and
control measures on public transport in the
context of COVID-19
29 April 2020
Scope of this document
This document provides advice on personal protective measures on public transport (e.g. bus, metro, train,
commuter boats).
Target audience
Public health authorities in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom.
Background
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, several EU/EEA countries and the UK have issued advice to travellers for
mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19 (e.g. respiratory etiquette, hand hygiene, etc.), and implemented local
transport restrictions in order to limit physical contacts between people. The European Commission outlines
some of these measures on the webpage on mobility and transport in the framework of the COVID-19 response,
examples of which are found below [1]:
Belgium: rescheduled offer of public transport
Belgium has rescheduled public transport during lockdown measures, reducing approximately 75% of public
transport services - while the use of those services has dropped to 8-10%. The general aim is to allow 1.5 metre
physical distancing on public transport [2,3].
Ireland: revised timetables for rail and bus passenger services
From 30 March 2020, the intercity services and the commuter services in the Dublin area have been reduced to
45-65% of the normal levels. Individual trains operate at maximum train size where possible to facilitate physical
distancing. Revised timetables have also been in place from the April for Dublin Bus, Go-Ahead Ireland and Bus
Éireann, with services running at approximately at 80% of normal levels [4].
Italy: rationalisation of inter-regional bus services and changes to rail passenger transport services
As of 13 March 2020, inter-regional non-scheduled bus services were rationalised due to restrictions on mobility
in the Italian territory [5]. This measure consisted of changes and reductions of non-scheduled services
authorised by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. A minimum level of services has been maintained [5].

Rail passenger transport was also rescheduled, reducing the traffic from 13 March 2020 for the protection of
passengers and railway employees [6]. For each route, a connection with at least one other scheduled train was
guaranteed [6].
Portugal: rationalisation and restrictions of public transport
Public transport services have been rescheduled in order to protect passengers and employees by: i) matching
supply and demand of transport needs, safeguarding the continuity of essential public service; ii) limiting the
maximum number of passengers to a third of the capacity of the vehicles; iii) ensuring enough distance between
staff and passengers; iv) implementing cleaning and disinfection of facilities and equipment used by passengers
[7].
Slovakia: limitation of national bus services and requirement to wear protective equipment
By decision of the Central Crisis Staff of Slovakia, from 13 March 2020, national bus services have been limited to
running on schedules similar to the ones on weekends or holidays. The Competent Authorities and carriers have
taken measures to ensure that all passengers are required to wear a face mask [1].
Slovenia: temporary prohibition and restrictions on public transport
Temporary bans and restrictions on public transport have been implemented in the Republic of Slovenia from 16
March 2020 for the purpose of containing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic [8].
Personal protective measures on public
transport in the context of COVID-19
Public transport is an essential service. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic there are two types of risks
related to public transport. First, crowding in public transport and their use by large numbers of people can
contribute to direct transmission of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets and indirect transmission through
contaminated surfaces; second, public transport staff are at increased risk of infection. The following measures
are recommended to mitigate these risks and maintain public transport services:
 Inform the passengers about the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and advise that they should not use
public transport if showing COVID-19 compatible symptoms (cough, sore throat, general weakness and
fatigue, and muscular pain) [9];
 Ensure physical distancing for service staff at booths, ideally behind glass or plastic panels;
 Consider using protective barriers for the driver, when the driving compartment is not physically
separated from the travellers [10];
 Disseminate information infographics for display in waiting areas, platforms and docks, explaining the
importance of physical distancing, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and the appropriate use of face
masks if advised by health authorities [11];
 Facilitate physical distancing on public transport:
 Prevent crowding in public transport and in the waiting areas through the provision of sufficient
vehicles and consider enhancing the service during rush hour times.
 Encourage physical distancing in the waiting areas only and allow the use of every other seat when
on the vehicle/wagon/boat.
 Consider reducing the maximum number of passengers per vehicle/wagon/boat to avoid crowding
and ensure physical distancing of at least one metre. If the distance is less than two metres, the
use of face masks may be considered.
 In buses, introduce boarding from the rear doors to ensure physical distancing from the driver if
the driving compartment is not physically separated from the travellers.
 Ensure the availability of face masks to staff [10] who are not physically separated from travellers when
working;
 Ensure proper ventilation in the vehicle/wagon/boat at all times. Avoid recirculating air and encourage the
use of windows, skylight panels and fans to increase replacement with fresh air. Such measures should be
adapted based on local conditions, needs and type of vehicles and other equipment in use;
 Remind the public about proper hand hygiene before boarding and after disembarking the
vehicle/wagon/boat. Consider making alcohol based hand-rub solutions available on the vehicles and at
transport hubs [10];
 Consider the use of face masks (medical or non-medical) for passengers on public transport, particularly if
physical distancing cannot be guaranteed, paying attention to proper mask use and disposal [11].

Cleaning and disinfection
The main route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is through inhalation of large respiratory droplets containing the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Contact with contaminated fomites due to persistence of the virus on surfaces is another
route implicated in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus [12]. In order to reduce the risk of infection through
contaminated fomites, it is essential to establish procedures for the correct cleaning and disinfection of
environments visited by many people.
Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. The environmental stability
of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolisation, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on
cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres
[12]. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with
caution in the real-life environment.
The following measures are recommended for cleaning and disinfection of public transport services:
 Ensure frequent cleaning and disinfection particularly of frequently touched surfaces such as handles and
rails following the suggested approach and products [13]. Cleaning of frequently touched surfaces in a
conveyance after each trip is recommended if possible;
 In areas with sustained community transmission, the likelihood that COVID-19 affected passengers have
been on board of a conveyance or in a closed waiting area (e.g. subway platform) is high. Therefore,
these areas should be kept well ventilated with fresh air as much as possible, and frequently and carefully
cleaned with a neutral detergent, followed by decontamination of surfaces using a disinfectant effective
against viruses. Several products with virucidal activity are licensed in the national markets and can be
used following the manufacturer’s instructions. Alternatively, 0.05-0.1% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)
(dilution 1:50, if household bleach is used, which is usually at an initial concentration of 2.5 to 5%) is
suggested. For surfaces that can be damaged by sodium hypochlorite, products based on ethanol (at
least 70%) can be used for decontamination after cleaning with a neutral detergent;
 The cleaning of public toilets, bathroom sinks and sanitary facilities used by several people (e.g. in
underground stations and on board of trains and boats) should be carefully performed. Consider the use
of a disinfectant effective against viruses, such as 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, or other licensed virucidal
products following the instructions for use provided by the manufacturer;
 Staff engaged in cleaning should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when performing cleaning
activities. More information on PPE can be found here [13];
 The cleaning material should be properly disinfected at the end of every cleaning session;
 Proper hand hygiene should be ensured by the cleaning staff each time PPE such as gloves are removed.
 Waste material produced during the cleaning should be placed in the unsorted garbage [13].
