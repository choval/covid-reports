TECHNICAL REPORT
Guidance for discharge and ending isolation in
the context of widespread community
transmission of COVID-19 – first update
8 April 2020
Scope of this document
This document provides guidance for planning discharge and ending isolation for COVID-19 patients in the
context of the phase of ongoing widespread community transmission.
Target audience
Public health institutes in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
Background
Since the publication of the first version of ECDC advice on discharge criteria for COVID-19 cases [1] and as of
the end of March 2020, all EU/EEA Member States and the UK report numerous cases and are experiencing
varying degrees of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In the context of widespread community transmission, with ongoing shortages of laboratory consumables and
reagents that affect diagnostic capacity, and with significant pressure on the health systems as a whole, the
former discharge criteria developed for the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 spread with no apparent sustained
community transmission, no pressure on healthcare facilities and optimal laboratory testing capacity are no
longer applicable at a large scale. In addition, almost all Member States have in place a stay-at-home strategy
for mild cases. Nonetheless, there is an increasing need to discharge patients from hospitals early after clinical
symptom improvement in order to maintain healthcare capacity for severe and critically ill patients.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for updated discharge criteria. The current update reflects the information
available at the time of publication and may change if more information on the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2
infection and viral shedding becomes available.

Scientific evidence on SARS-CoV-2 shedding
Incubation period: The median incubation period is considered to be five to six days for COVID-19, with a
range from one to 14 days. According to modelling data it remains prudent to consider a period of at least 14
days as an upper limit of the incubation period [2,3].
Viral shedding: Over the course of the infection, viral RNA has been identified in respiratory tract specimens up
to 1–2 days before the onset of symptoms. Viral load persists up to eight days after the onset of symptoms in
mild cases and peaks in day 11 in more severe cases[4-5]. The current update reflects these findings. However,
more research is needed on the level and duration of viral shedding in the various patient groups and in the
context of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections. There is no evidence on the duration of viral shedding
after resolution of fever.
In terms of viral load profile, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, which peaks at around the time of
symptom onset, but contrasts with that of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which peak in the second week after
symptom onset. Older age and more severe infections have been associated with higher viral loads [5,6]. Viral
RNA has been detected in faeces from day five after symptom onset and up to four to five weeks in moderate
cases, as well as in whole blood [7], serum [8,9], saliva [3,6] and urine [6,10].
Prolonged viral RNA shedding has been reported from nasopharyngeal swabs (up to 37 days after onset of
symptoms among adult patients) [11] and in faeces (more than one month after infection in paediatric patients)
[12]. The viral load can be a potentially useful marker for assessing disease severity and prognosis: a recent
study indicated that viral loads in severe cases were up to 60 times higher than in mild cases [5]. Although there
is no specific evidence for COVID-19, immunocompromised patients may shed SARS-CoV-2 virus for prolonged
periods similar to other respiratory viruses.
Viral RNA shedding of SARS-CoV-2 does not equate with infectivity, unless there is proof that the virus can be
isolated and cultured from the particular samples. On the other hand, the infectious dose has not been
determined; therefore, it is unclear how much virus is needed to infect humans.
Infection in asymptomatic individuals: Asymptomatic infection at time of laboratory confirmation has been
reported from many settings, with a large proportion of these cases experiencing some symptoms at a later
stage of infection [6]. There are, however, also reports of cases remaining asymptomatic throughout the whole
duration of laboratory and clinical monitoring. Viral RNA, as well as infectious virus has been detected in
asymptomatic patients [13-15].
Transmission in pre-symptomatic stage of infection: In symptomatic patients, the high viral load close to
symptom onset suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmissible at an early stage of infection [6,15-18].
Uncertainties remain with regards to the influence of pre-symptomatic transmission on the overall transmission
dynamics of the pandemic because of the suboptimal level of evidence on transmission from asymptomatic cases
mostly originating from case reports. Comparable viral loads in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients also
indicate the potential of virus transmission from asymptomatic patients.
Pre-symptomatic transmission has been inferred through modelling, and the proportion of pre-symptomatic
transmission was estimated between 48% and 62% [19]. Pre-symptomatic transmission was deemed likely
based on a shorter serial interval of COVID-19 (4.0 to 4.6 days) than the mean incubation period (five days). The
authors indicated that many secondary transmissions would have already occurred at the time when
symptomatic cases are detected and isolated [18,20,21].
Immunity: Based on the currently available data, the IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 develop between
6-15 days post-disease onset [4,22-26]. However, clinically validated laboratory assays for detection of
antibodies are still lacking and therefore these results need to be considered cautiously. In addition, correlates of
protection are still to be defined which is necessary to be able to comment on the possibility of re-infection and
the duration of immunity.
In summary, and based on limited evidence from one study indicating that viral load persists up to eight days
after the onset of symptoms in mild cases and longer in more severe cases (peaking in the second week),
patients should continue self-isolation at home or in a safe place if they are discharged from hospital before this
period. Immunocompromised and patients with severe illness, as well as healthcare workers, should be
prioritised for testing to exclude the possibility of prolonged shedding.

Overview of current practice
An overview of recommendations for discharge and ending isolation of COVID-19 patients from national bodies in
several EU/EEA Member States, other countries that experienced large numbers of COVID-19 cases and WHO is
presented in Annex 1.
Discharge and ending isolation criteria
When deciding on criteria for hospital discharge of COVID-19 patients, guidance for ending home isolation of
mild cases and guidance for critical infrastructure responders (e.g. healthcare workers, law enforcement etc.)
returning to work after COVID-19 illness, health authorities should take into account several factors such as the
existing capacity of the healthcare system, laboratory diagnostic resources, and the current epidemiological
situation.
COVID-19 patients may be discharged based on: a) clinical resolution of symptoms, and b) evidence for viral
RNA clearance from the upper respiratory tract, where testing capacity permits. In order to protect the
healthcare system capacity, in the context of widespread community transmission and limited testing capacity,
clinical criteria will gain priority (Table 1).
Discharge and ending isolation criteria may be adapted for specific groups of patients.
Table 1. Guidance on discharge and ending isolation in the context of widespread community
transmission
COVID-19 case status Description Guidance
Hospitalised suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 cases
This category refers to:
 Patients who are
hospitalised with
suspected or laboratory
confirmed COVID-19
(mild, severe and critically
ill) [27]
 Confirmed COVID-19
patients discharged early,
due to clinical
improvement
If testing and hospitalisation capacity allows,
 For a clinically recovered patient, two negative RT-PCR
tests from respiratory specimens at 24 hours interval at
least eight days after onset of symptoms [4]
If limited/no testing capacity,
 Patient can be discharged based on clinical criteria, per
evaluation of the treating physician, AND
 the discharged patient should self-isolate at home or in a
safe place until resolution of fever for at least three days
and clinical improvement of other symptoms AND
 until eight days after the onset of symptoms for mild
cases or for 14 days (severe cases) if these criteria have
not been fulfilled in hospital.
 Follow-up visits, or monitoring via phone or other
electronic device can be considered.
 These patients should be prioritised for testing.
Discharged to closed
population environment
(long-term care facility,
prison, children with special
needs etc.)
The patient should be placed in a single room until eight
days after the onset of symptoms have passed AND
resolution of fever for at least for three days AND clinical
improvement of other symptoms.
Immunocompromised
patients
Self-isolation should last until all of the following criteria are
fulfilled: at least 14 days after symptom onset AND
resolution of fever for at least three days AND clinical
improvement of symptoms other than fever.
Mild suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 cases
This category refers to:
 Confirmed COVID-19
patients never hospitalised
due to mild symptoms or
asymptomatic presentation
 Suspected or probable
COVID-19 patients in the
community, who adhered
to the stay-at-home advice
by the national authorities
 These patients can end self-isolation eight days after the
onset of symptoms AND resolution of fever AND clinical
improvement of other symptoms for at least for three
days.

COVID-19 case status Description Guidance
Critical infrastructure
responders (e.g. heathcare
workers, law enforcement,
firefighters etc.)
 End isolation after resolution of fever for at least three
days AND after eight days from the onset of symptoms
have passed. Healthcare workers can return to work
immediately after that, using a surgical mask during work
hours until 14 days after the onset of symptoms have
passed*.
 If testing capacity allows, for a clinically recovered
patient, two negative RT-PCR tests from respiratory
specimens at 24 hours interval, at least eight days after
onset of symptoms. Critical infrastructure responders,
especially HCWs, should be considered a priority group
for testing during the pandemic.
Family members and other
categories of contacts of
COVID-19 patients
This category refers to:
 Partners and spouses
 Family members and other
persons sharing housing
or taking care of COVID-
19 patients
For guidance on household care of a COVID-19 case, refer
to the relevant ECDC guidance [28].
Caretakers of COVID-19 patients should self-quarantine for
14 days after last contact with sick spouse/relative.
Caretakers or family members that develop symptoms in the
14-day quarantine period, should stay in home isolation for
eight days after onset of symptoms AND until resolution of
fever for at least three days AND clinical improvement of
other symptoms, or seek medical care, if symptoms worsen.
*Healthcare workers and other critical infrastructure responders are advised to wear a facemask for14 days after the onset of
their symptoms, to cover the possibility of prolonged viral shedding in order to protect vulnerable patients in their care from
being infected.
Although the oral-faecal route does not appear to be a driver of transmission, its significance remains to be
determined. Discharged patients should be advised to strictly follow personal hygiene precautions in order to
protect household contacts. This applies to all convalescing patients, but particularly to convalescent children
[28].
For persons in voluntary or mandatory quarantine as a traveller or contact of a confirmed case, they should
follow the instructions of the national public health authorities. Usually the duration of quarantine in the context
of the COVID-19 epidemic is 14 days.

(see footnote ***)
Note: Green boxes indicate the policy in use (e.g. Estonia, clinical criteria for both hospital discharge and end of home-
isolation). NA: not reported/not identified through the desk review.
*UK: The 14-day household-isolation period will have greatly reduced the overall amount of infection the rest of the household
could pass on, and it is not necessary to restart 14 days of isolation for the whole household. This will have provided a high
level of community protection. Further isolation of members of this household will provide very little additional community
protection.
**USA: Still valid (contingent on the availability of ample testing supplies and laboratory capacity as well as convenient access
to testing): at least two consecutive sets of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected ≥ 24 hours apart from a patient with
COVID-19 (a total of four negative specimens); and resolution of fever, without use of antipyretic medication, improvement in
illness signs and symptoms.
***WHO: In hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19, repeat URT and LRT samples can be collected to demonstrate
viral clearance. The frequency of specimen collection will depend on local epidemic characteristics and resources.
