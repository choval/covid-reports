PREPARE
What to do if you have a chronic disease?
How can you prepare yourself
Educate yourself on COVID-19 from trusted sources.
Refill your prescription medicines or consider using a
mail-order for your medications.
Have over-the-counter medicines and medical
supplies (e.g. tissues, thermometer) to treat fever.
As much as feasible, keep physically active to ensure
good physical condition.
Have enough groceries and household items,
approximately 2-4 weeks. Prepare gradually and avoid
panic buying.
Activate your social network. Contact family, friends,
neighbours or community health care workers in
advance and make joint plans on what to do when
COVID-19 is spreading in your community or if you
become ill.
Follow instructions from national authorities on how to
prepare for emergencies.
Continue to practice general hygiene.
Before eating, after using the toilet;
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing;
After having been in public places;
After having touched surfaces in public places;
After having touched other people.
Avoid meetings, events and other social
gatherings in areas with ongoing community
transmission.
If you develop cough, once COVID-19 is
spreading in your community, use medical
facemasks. This will protect those around
you from getting infected.
