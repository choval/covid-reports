Yesterday, Thailand Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha announced that Thailand is preparing “just in case”
for worst-case scenarios, readying hospitals and ensuring adequate supplies of medical equipment and
supplies to cope with any escalation of the epidemic. COVID-19 will be added to a list of dangerous
infectious diseases giving the Government authority to respond quickly.

were evacuated from Wuhan, China have completed their 14-day quarantine period and returned home.
The one confirmed COVID-19 case among the group remains under observation at a Chonburi hospital,
and is reported to be doing well.
Authorities have tested 1489 samples for COVID-19 to date. Six laboratories are presently authorized to
perform tests; the Government seeks to expand capacity for testing to at least one hospital per province
soon.
WHO reiterates that health screening and surveillance systems in Thailand – at points of entry into the
country as well as nationwide - are robust and capable of tracking suspected cases quickly, allowing health
authorities to implement protocols to ensure isolation, contact tracing, testing and treatment of symptoms.

As of 21 February 2020

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including by the
virus causing COVID-19, include the following:
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially
in emergency departments.
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of
respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share
their travel history with their healthcare provider.

health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further spread within
as well as to and from Thailand i;
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; and
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing

pending approval by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet).
With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested.
The Health Ministry is conducting modelling exercises with the National Research Council of Thailand to
forecast possible scenarios and outcomes as the outbreak evolves in Thailand.
Visitors to Thailand who have recently been to affected areas are being provided information upon arrival
by the Ministry of Public Health, including how to report any possible illness to the Department of Disease
Control using the 1422 hotline.
