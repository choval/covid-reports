of March 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand
(MoPH) announced three new cases of COVID-19, all Thai nationals,
bringing the total number of cases in Thailand to 53.
• One case is a female, age 41, who has not traveled abroad recently, and
has been in close contact with one of the confirmed cases announced on
7 March, a Thai national who had recently traveled to Italy. This case was
detected by contact-tracing following confirmation of the earlier case.
• The other two cases are a man, age 47, with no travel history, who had
symptoms, went to a hospital and was diagnosed and confirmed with
COVID-19. His wife, age 46, who had recently returned from travel to Italy,
was then also tested and confirmed as a case.
• Of the 53 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Thailand, 33 have recovered, 19 are in hospital
and one has died. 40 are imported cases, and 13 are locally-transmitted cases.
• There are 1,875 PUIs, this number includes people being treated for other conditions who are no longer
suspected of having COVID-19 infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including by the
virus causing COVID-19, include the following:
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).

WHO THAILAND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO Thailand’s strategic objectives to support Thailand’s response are to:
• Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further spread within
as well as to and from Thailandi
;
• Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; and
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing
• Thailand has strong capacities for case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis,
clinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication.
• Thailand is also updating its dedicated national pandemic influenza preparedness plan (pending approval
by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet).
• With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested.
• The Health Ministry is conducting modelling exercises with the National Research Council of Thailand to
forecast possible scenarios and outcomes as the outbreak evolves in Thailand.
• Visitors to Thailand traveling from affected areas are being screened and provided information upon arrival
by the Ministry of Public Health, including how to report any possible illness to the Department of Disease
Control using the 1422 hotline.
• The Ministry has also introduced a self-reporting online tool, available in Thai, English and Chinese, which
can be accessed here.
