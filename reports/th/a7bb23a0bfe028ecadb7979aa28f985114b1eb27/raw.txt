THAILAND SITUATION
As of 7 February 2020, there are still 25 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV
IN NUMBERS
cases reported by health authorities in Thailand, 21 of them persons from
total and new cases in
last 24 hours
China, including Wuhan city of Hubei Province, who visited Thailand.
390 persons are under investigation with tests being carried out, while 225
have been treated for symptoms and discharged.
25 confirmed
The confirmed cases of Thai nationals include two taxi drivers who likely
No new cases reported
came into contact with infected passengers from China. The Thai
390 persons under
authorities are conducting a hygiene and safety campaign aimed at
investigation
citizens who come into close contact with international visitors or who
otherwise operate in crowded environments.
There are also two Thai nationals who traveled to Japan and displayed symptoms after returning to Thailand,
but health authorities say it’s as yet unclear where they acquired their infection.
A confirmed case in the Republic of Korea had travelled to Thailand prior to onset of illness and diagnosis.
The timeline in this case suggests it is possible infection could have been acquired in either Thailand or in
the Republic of Korea after the person returned home.
138 Thai nationals who were in Wuhan, China, and who returned to Thailand on 4 February, are in
quarantine at Navy guesthouses for a duration of 14 days. All are said to be doing well. Physical
examinations and laboratory tests are being conducted for the entire group.
Screening at airports has identified fewer and fewer possible cases in recent days. However, screening has
been further intensified at prominent ports in Thailand amid reports that another 41 persons on a cruise ship
off the coast of Japan have tested positive for novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases on
board there to 61.

MEDIA




Media coverage of the outbreak continues to be high, including news of the outbreak from China and other
countries.
WHO Thailand continues to receive media queries about the outbreak, and is revamping its website to better
present relevant content on a regular basis to the public and other constituencies. Media queries can be
directed to sethawebmaster@who.int or kanpirom@who.int
WHO Representative to Thailand, Dr Daniel Kertesz, participated in a panel discussion on the outbreak with
the Ministry of Public Health/Department of Disease Control and the Thai Red Cross this week at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Thailand. The discussion can be accessed here: https://youtu.be/Bt8ThjwFAXw.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO Thailand’s strategic objectives to support Thailand’s response are to:






Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further spread within as
well as to and from Thailand i;
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing







Thailand has strong capacities for case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis,
clinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication.
Thailand also recently updated its dedicated national pandemic influenza preparedness plan (currently
pending approval by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet).
With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested; this support is currently being provided to Myanmar, and support for the Maldives
is also being arranged.
A special advisory group consisting of former high-level health officials has been formed to support the
Health Ministry in its response to the outbreak.
The Health Ministry will be conducting modelling exercises with the National Research Council of Thailand
to forecast possible scenarios and outcomes as the outbreak evolves in Thailand.
Visitors to Thailand who have recently been in Wuhan, China, and other affected areas are being provided
information upon arrival by the Ministry of Public Health, including how to report any possible illness to the
Department of Disease Control:

What WHO is doing in Thailand






WHO Thailand has been in regular and direct contact with the Royal Thai Government through the Ministry
of Public Health
WHO shares information with the Government including key developments elsewhere, as well as guidelines
and updates;
WHO facilitates the external sharing of the virus between researchers to contribute to regional and global
efforts to develop a vaccine and strengthen efforts to combat the outbreak;
WHO facilitates support from the WHO collaborating centre in Hong Kong for infectious disease modelling
as required;
WHO supports the wider UN response and provides relevant information and advice to staff of the UN
system in Thailand

What WHO is doing globally

WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed
to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first
cases of 2019-nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of
public health guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.
WHO has developed interim global guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during
home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical
management, infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected
novel coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human
infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
WHO has published updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
WHO has activated an R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses,
including novel coronaviruses.
WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a
new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance
and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help
understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational
models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several
protocols are available here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technicalguidance/early-investigations
WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which is updated
regularly.
WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and
control, clinical management and mathematical modelling.

This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of
the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health
measures for travellers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication
