HIGHLIGHTS
• Today, 15 February 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand
announced a new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 novel coronavirus
case, the 34th
confirmed case in the country so far.
• The case reported today is that of a 35-year-old health care worker who
tended to a COVID-19 patient at a private hospital. According to the
Ministry’s report, the health care worker did not wear a mask consistently
while looking after the patient.
• WHO reiterates that health screening and surveillance systems in
Thailand – at points of entry into the country as well as nationwide - are
robust and capable of tracking suspected cases quickly, allowing health
authorities to implement protocols to ensure isolation, contact tracing, testing and treatment of symptoms.
• Today’s report also indicates the importance of all health care personnel rigorously applying the required
infection control measures when caring for suspected cases, including the correct use of appropriate face
masks.
• Meanwhile, two COVID-19 patients, a 70-year-old man and a 30-year-old man, both of whom suffered from
serious underlying medical conditions before infection, remain in what authorities describe as a “severe
condition.”
• Additionally, the 30-year-old man is reported to be on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), also
known as extracorporeal life support, which is a technique of providing prolonged cardiac and respiratory
support to a person whose heart and lungs are unable to provide an adequate amount of gas exchange or
perfusion (the passage of blood, a blood substitute or other fluid through the blood vessels or other natural
channels in an organ or tissue) to sustain life.
• The Ministry of Public Health also reports that 130 persons are currently under investigation, while 674 have
been treated for symptoms and discharged. (These numbers have been revised downward by the Ministry
of Public Health, after duplication of data was discovered.)
• 138 Thai nationals remain under a 14-day quarantine at Navy guesthouses after having been brought back
to their country from Wuhan, China on 4 February. This quarantine period expires in the coming week. A
man among this group who tested positive for novel coronavirus after displaying flu-like symptoms on 7
February is said to be doing well.
• The WHO R&D Blueprint is a global strategy and preparedness plan that allows the rapid activation of R&D
activities during epidemics. On 11-12 February, WHO convened a global research and innovation forum in
Geneva to mobilize international action and enable identification of key knowledge gaps and research
priorities to contribute to the control of COVID-19. The forum included members of the scientific community,
researchers from Member States’ public health agencies including from Thailand, regulatory experts and
major funders of research related to COVID-19. During the meeting, the more than 300 participants agreed
on a set of global research priorities and outlined mechanisms for continuing scientific interactions and
collaborations beyond the meeting, to be coordinated and facilitated by WHO. They consulted with research
funders to determine how necessary resources can be mobilized so that critical research can start
immediately. The resulting roadmap will be used by researchers and funders to accelerate the research
response.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).

WHO Thailand Situation Report – 15 February 2020
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially
in emergency departments.
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of
respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share
their travel history with their healthcare provider.
MEDIA
• Media coverage of the outbreak continues to be high in Thailand, including news of the outbreak from
China and other countries.
• WHO Thailand continues to receive media queries about the outbreak, and has revamped its website
to better present relevant content on a regular basis to the public and other constituencies. Media
queries can be directed to sethawebmaster@who.int or kanpirom@who.int
• WHO Thailand’s Twitter and Facebook accounts post useful information on hygiene and protection,
such as when and how to use masks, as well as relevant WHO technical guidelines and other content
related to the novel coronavirus situation in Thailand and globally.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO Thailand’s strategic objectives to support Thailand’s response are to:
• Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further spread within as
well as to and from Thailand i
;
• Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing
• Thailand has strong capacities for case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis,
clinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication.
• Thailand also recently updated its dedicated national pandemic influenza preparedness plan (currently
pending approval by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet).
• With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested; this support is currently being provided to Myanmar, and support for Indonesia and
the Maldives is also being arranged.
• A special advisory group consisting of former high-level health officials has been formed to support the
Health Ministry in its response to the outbreak.
• The Health Ministry is conducting modelling exercises with the National Research Council of Thailand to
forecast possible scenarios and outcomes as the outbreak evolves in Thailand.
• Visitors to Thailand who have recently been in Wuhan, China, and other affected areas are being provided
information upon arrival by the Ministry of Public Health, including how to report any possible illness to the
Department of Disease Control using the 1422 hotline from anywhere in Thailand.
• The Ministry has also introduced a self-reporting online tool, available in Thai, English and Chinese, which
can be accessed here.
What WHO is doing in Thailand
• WHO Thailand has been in regular and direct contact with the Royal Thai Government through the Ministry
of Public Health;
• WHO shares information with the Government including key developments elsewhere, as well as guidelines
and updates;
• WHO facilitates the external sharing of the virus between researchers to contribute to regional and global
efforts to develop a vaccine and strengthen efforts to combat the outbreak;
• WHO will also be helping facilitate research collaboration between Thai researchers and those from other
parts of WHO’s global research network;
• WHO facilitates support from the WHO collaborating centre in Hong Kong for infectious disease modelling
as required;
• WHO supports the wider UN response and provides relevant information and advice to staff of the UN
system in Thailand;
• WHO is collaborating with UNICEF on supporting the Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Education in
relation to special measures in schools and other educational institutions to safeguard against the spread
of 2019-nCoV.
What WHO is doing globally
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed
to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first
cases of 2019-nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of
public health guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.
• WHO has developed interim global guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during
home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical
management, infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected
novel coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human
infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
• WHO has published updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
• WHO has activated an R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses,
including novel coronaviruses.
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a
new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance
and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help
understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational
models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several
protocols are available here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-
guidance/early-investigations
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which is updated
regularly.
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and
control, clinical management and mathematical modelling.
