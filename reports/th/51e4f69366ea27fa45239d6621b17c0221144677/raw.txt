UPDATE FROM THE MINISTRY
OF PUBLIC HEALTH
COVID-19 response plan for Thailand
• COVID-19 response measures are managed by
local authorities based on a national framework.
The enhanced measures to be applied will vary
according to the level of assessed risk (the degree
to which the epidemic is under control).
• Basic measures that will be implemented by all
provinces, regardless of level of risk are as follows:
Promoting health literacy on prevention and control
of COVID-19, including personal hygiene
Active case detection and isolation of case, tracing
and quarantining their contacts
Protection of vulnerable groups i.e. the elderly those
with chronic diseases
Healthcare facility preparedness, including
enhanced infection prevention and control
Increasing social distancing by promoting:
Working from home: (70% of government
employees) and flexible/staggered working hours
to reduce crowding of public transportation
Online business (shopping, banking, etc.)
Measures to be applied in the direct service sector
(e.g. shops and businesses)
