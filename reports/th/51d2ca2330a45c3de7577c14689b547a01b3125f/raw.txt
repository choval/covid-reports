UPDATE FROM THE MINISTRY
OF PUBLIC HEALTH
COVID-19 response plan for Thailand
• COVID-19 response measures are managed by
local authorities based on a national framework.
The enhanced measures to be applied will vary
according to the level of assessed risk (the degree
to which the epidemic is under control).
• Basic measures that will be implemented by all
provinces, regardless of level of risk are as follows:
Promoting health literacy on prevention and control
of COVID-19, including personal hygiene
Active case detection and isolation of case, tracing
and quarantining their contacts
Protection of vulnerable groups i.e. the elderly those
with chronic diseases
Healthcare facility preparedness, including
enhanced infection prevention and control
Increasing social distancing by promoting::
Working from home: (70% of government
employees) and flexible / staggered working hours
to reduce crowding of public transportation
Online business (shopping, banking, etc.)
Measures to be applied in the direct service sector
(e.g. shops and businesses)

What who is doing to provide support to Thailand
WHO Thailand is in frequent direct contact with the Royal Thai
Government through the Ministry of Public Health, sharing
information on key developments, guidelines and scientific
updates.
WHO supports the wider UN response, including working with
key partners and the Ministry of Public Health to support migrant
populations in Thailand. WHO also provides information and
advice to staff of the UN system in Thailand.
Media
WHO Thailand’s website, Twitter and Facebook accounts, regularly
provide content on all aspects of the outbreak in Thailand
and around the world. Media queries can be directed to
sethawebmaster@who.int and kanpirom@who.int
• Additional measures – may be applied locally on a
compulsory basis, or based on the assessed level
of risk
Travel restrictions and screening
Closure of establishments where people may gather
in large numbers or the risk of transmission is high
Curfew
• Principles for easing the compulsory measures
Continuous monitoring and assessment of risk at
local level
Assessment of whether establishments/venues are
considered to provide essential services
Degree of compliance with measures by
establishments/service providers and the local
population
ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
Antibody testing
• The MoPH does not recommend antibody
tests to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis. Selling
kits online is illegal.
• During days 1-7 after symptom onset the
tests are only about 17% sensitive. During
days 8-14 this can rise to 42% sensitivity.
After 14 days, the tests may be 85%
sensitive. Therefore, antibody tests are not
useful for confirmation of current infection.
Mask use
• The Ministry of Public Health notes that an
online survey on mask use showed that 4%
of survey respondents said they don’t wear
a mask when they are sick. 53.2% wear
cloth masks and 40.1% wear surgical masks.
• The MoPH recommends that everyone
wear masks in public places to prevent pre-
asymptomatic transmission.
