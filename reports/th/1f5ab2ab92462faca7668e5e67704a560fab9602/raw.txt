While debates continue about lifting restrictions designed to slow the
COVID-19 infection rate, it is important to remember that the danger has
not passed.
While some gains have been made in reducing the number of new cases,
we cannot relax our guard.
It is just as important now as it was the beginning of the outbreak to
follow basic precautions such as handwashing, respiratory hygiene and
physical distancing.
