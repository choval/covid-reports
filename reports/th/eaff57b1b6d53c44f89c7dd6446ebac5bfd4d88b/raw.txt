ANALYSIS
The proportion of COVID-19 cases detected outside of Bangkok is increasing; cases have now been reported
in more than 2/3rds
of Thailand’s provinces. Sub-national public health capacity is robust, including extensive
networks of Rapid Response Teams and Village Health Volunteers. These networks will work to identify
suspected cases, ensure they are quickly isolated from others, treat them and trace and quarantine their close
contacts. Rapidly separating infected persons from others minimizes opportunities for spread of the virus and
is effective in preventing disease in the population. The goal is to interrupt spread and contain COVID-19 in
every affected Province.
Everyone can play their part by staying at home when possible, maintaining 1-2 m distance from others if they
must go out, washing hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer, avoiding touching
the mouth and nose, and observing respiratory hygiene (coughing into flexed elbow or a tissue which is
disposed of safely). Anyone who has recently travelled to any province from Bangkok in the past 14 days, and
