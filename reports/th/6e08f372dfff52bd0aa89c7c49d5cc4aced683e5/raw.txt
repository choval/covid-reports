social distancing.
• Increasing numbers of cases are being identified in Thailand’s provinces. The MOPH asks all persons
coming from Bangkok to report to the designated Communicable Diseases Officers in their sub-district.
They are requested to carefully monitor their health, practice respiratory hygiene and social distancing
(remain at home, maintain a distance of 1 meter from other persons).
• As of March 22nd, 370 cases have been male (67.2%) and 229 females (32.8%). Cases have ranged

are severe) in healthcare settings and one has died.
• There is now a cumulative total of 10,955 Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) in Thailand since the COVID-
19 outbreak began, including 5,341 people being actively investigated or treated. This group includes people

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
The Governors of Bangkok, five neighboring provinces and Chiang Mai have imposed urgent measures to
ensure social distancing, including closing a range of retail business until at least April 12th. People living in
these areas are requested to remain inside their homes and to limit all social contacts. The MOPH has urged
workers of retail businesses in Bangkok not to travel to their hometowns in order to prevent the spread of
coronavirus to their families. The National Communicable Disease Committee has asked all Provincial
Governors to develop action plans for screening, case- finding and disease prevention measures at the
district and sub-district levels. Some provinces are seeing their first cases. Testing, isolating positive cases
and tracing their contacts to limit ongoing transmission of the virus, is an essential public health response at
this moment. These activities, combined with strict social distancing measures, are the best tools currently
available to combat the pandemic.
The basic principles to reduce the risk of contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 include the following:
• Remain inside your home. Leave your home only for essential activities (e.g. to seek medical care or to
purchase food).
• Frequently wash your hands, especially after any contact with ill people or their environment. An alcohol-
based hand rub is also effective
• Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
• People with symptoms should cover coughs sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and frequently
wash their hands.
• Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from all other persons at all times.
• Do not shake hands, embrace, share eating utensils or smoking devices with other people.
• Avoid contact with people suffering any symptoms of acute respiratory infection.
• If you are feeling unwell, wear a cloth or paper mask. Do not use N95 respirators as supplies are limited
and they are critically needed for healthcare workers.
• Keep all commonly touched surfaces clean, using disinfectants that are active against enveloped viruses,
such as.70% Ethyl alcohol or Sodium hypochlorite at 0.5% (equivalent 5000ppm).
EXPLAINER: Thailand joins the WHO Solidarity Trial – Global Testing of COVID-19 Drugs
Thailand will join the World Health Organization’s “Solidarity Trial” – an eight-country clinical study for potential
treatments for COVID-19, part of a rapid global search for drugs to treat COVID-19. In addition to Thailand, the
multi-arm, multi-country trial will include the participation of Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway,
South Africa, Spain and Switzerland. The Solidarity trial will test four different drugs or combinations – a)
remdesivir, b) a combination of two drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, c) the two drugs plus interferon beta, and d)
chloroquine – and will compare their effectiveness to what is called standard of care — the regular support
hospitals treating COVID-19 patients use now.
MEDIA
• WHO Thailand continues to receive media queries about the outbreak and through its website provides
relevant content on a regular basis to the public and other constituencies. Media queries can be directed to
sethawebmaster@who.int and risleyp@who.int
• WHO Thailand’s Twitter and Facebook accounts post useful information on hygiene and protection, such
as when and how to use masks, as well as relevant WHO technical guidelines and other content related to
the novel coronavirus situation in Thailand and globally.
WHO THAILAND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO Thailand’s strategic objectives to support Thailand’s response are to:
• Limit transmission to citizens and health care workers thereby slowing the spread of the virus
• Rapidly identify, isolate and provide the best available care for all patients
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission, viral shedding, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing
• Thailand has strong capacities for case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis,
clinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication.
• Thailand is also updating its national pandemic influenza preparedness plan (pending approval by the Prime
Minister’s Cabinet).
• With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested.
• Visitors to Thailand traveling from affected areas are being screened and provided information upon arrival
by the Ministry of Public Health, including how to report any possible illness to the Department of Disease
Control using the 1422 hotline.
• The Ministry has also introduced a self-reporting online tool, available in Thai, English and Chinese, which
can be accessed here.
What WHO is doing in Thailand
• WHO Thailand remains in frequent direct contact with the Royal Thai Government through the Ministry of
Public Health, sharing information on key developments, guidelines and scientific updates
• WHO supports the wider UN response and provides relevant information and advice to staff of the UN
system in Thailand.
