HIGHLIGHTS
• On the 19th of April 2020, 32 new cases of laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 were announced by the Ministry of Public Health of
Thailand, bringing the total number of cases to 2,765.
• Of these, more than 65% (1,928) have recovered, about 1.7% (47)
have died, and almost 33% (790) are receiving treatment.
• No cases were identified in people returning from outside Thailand;
likely reflecting restrictions on entry.
• A total of 18 of the new cases are close contacts of previously confirmed cases. Five cases either attended
crowded places or had occupational exposure to large numbers of people.
• To date, 68 of the total 77 provinces have reported cases. Thirty-three provinces have not reported any
new cases during the past 14 days.
The current overall case fatality rate among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand is 1.8%. While this rate is
lower than in some European countries (France: 16.2%; Italy: 13.1%; Spain: 10.5%), it is higher than in others
(Iceland: 0.46%; Australia: 0.97%; Israel 1.03%). Because there is usually a delay of several days up to a month
between diagnosis and death, the fatality rate can be expected to increase in the coming weeks. Case fatality
increases with age and men are more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 0.7%). These findings are
consistent with reports from other countries. In men older than 60 years, the fatality rate is currently 8.8%.
