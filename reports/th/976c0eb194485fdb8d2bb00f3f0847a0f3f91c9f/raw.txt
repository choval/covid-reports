• Prime Minister Prayuth Chan Ocha issued a National Emergency Decree effective 26th March until April
30th. This decree authorizes certain government agencies to effect or enforce specific actions necessary
to reduce transmission of the pandemic virus and bring the epidemic under control. The public is
requested to remain inside their homes and to limit all social contacts. The MOPH urges the workers of
retail business in Bangkok not to travel to their hometowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus to their
families. The National Communicable Disease Committee has asked all provincial Governors to
implement screening, case finding and disease prevention measures at district and sub-district levels.
Testing, isolating positive cases and tracing their contacts to limit ongoing transmission of the virus, is an
essential public health response at this moment. These activities, combined with strict social distancing
measures, are the best tools currently available to combat the pandemic.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
To reduce the risk of contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 observe the following:
• Remain inside your home. Leave your home only for essential activities (e.g. medical care, purchase food).
• Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from all other persons at all times.
• Frequently wash your hands, especially after contact with ill people or their environment. An alcohol-based
hand rub is also effective
• Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
• If unwell, wear a cloth or paper mask. Do not use N95 respirators as supplies are limited and they are
critically needed for healthcare workers.
• Cover coughs & sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing and frequently wash your hands.
• Do not shake hands, embrace, share eating utensils or smoking devices with other people.
• Avoid contact with people suffering any symptoms of acute respiratory infection.
• Keep all commonly touched surfaces clean. Advice on cleaning practices and the survivability of the SARS-
CoV-2 virus on surfaces & in different settings is available here.
