RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
The Thailand MOPH recommends that people using public transportation clean their hands each time they
leave the train, bus or taxi. Upon arriving home, people should wash their hands, shower, change cloths before
interacting family members.
The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including by the
virus causing COVID-19, include the following:
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance,
cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals,
especially in emergency departments.
• Advice from WHO on cleaning practices and the survivability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces & in
different settings, available here.
• WHO does not recommend specific health measures for travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of
respiratory illness either during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share
their travel history with their healthcare provider.

WHO THAILAND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO Thailand’s strategic objectives to support Thailand’s response are to:
•
•
•
•
•

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further spread within as
well as to and from Thailand i;
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; and
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing
•
•
•
•
•

Thailand has strong capacities for case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis,
clinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication.
Thailand is also updating its national pandemic influenza preparedness plan (pending approval by the Prime
Minister’s Cabinet).
With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested.
Visitors to Thailand traveling from affected areas are being screened and provided information upon arrival
by the Ministry of Public Health, including how to report any possible illness to the Department of Disease
Control using the 1422 hotline.
The Ministry has also introduced a self-reporting online tool, available in Thai, English and Chinese, which
can be accessed here.

What WHO is doing in Thailand
•
•

WHO Thailand remains in regular and direct contact with the Royal Thai Government through the Ministry
of Public Health, sharing information with the Government including key developments elsewhere, as well
as guidelines and updates.
WHO supports the wider UN response and provides relevant information and advice to staff of the UN
system in Thailand.

“You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We
have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case. If they test positive,
isolate them and find out who they have been in close contact with up to 2 days before they developed
symptoms, and test those people too.” WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 16 March,
Geneva.
