EXPLAINER: COVID-19 and non-communicable diseases
People with pre-existing non-communicable diseases (NCDs)

virus. These NCDs include: cardiovascular disease (e.g.
hypertension, persons who have had, or are at risk for, a heart
attack or stroke); chronic respiratory disease (e.g. COPD);
diabetes, cancer, or chronic kidney disease.
If you have a pre-existing condition:
• Continue taking your medication and follow medical advice
• Do not go out unless essential, e.g, for medical care
• Maintain a distance from others
• Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
• Avoid touching your eyes and nose
• Maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating a healthy diet, staying
active, quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol, getting enough sleep
and safeguarding your mental health
