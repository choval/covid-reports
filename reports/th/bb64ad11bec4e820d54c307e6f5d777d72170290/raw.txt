•

All eleven new cases are Thai nationals, their ages range from 25-38. The
cases were part of a group of 15 people who attended a party at a venue
in Bangkok; the remaining four people all tested negative.

•

The first person in this group to become unwell developed symptoms on
25 February, before joining their friends several days later. Beginning 4th
March, some friends started to develop symptoms, leading to the laboratory confirmation of COVID-19
infection in the other 10 cases. Contact tracing of 70 friends and family members has not identified any
additional cases.

•

The MoPH also announced that they expect COVID-19 testing capacity to be expanded to all Regional and
some Provincial laboratories within the next 2 weeks.

•

Of the 70 COVID-19 cases reported in Thailand, 35 have recovered, 34 are in hospital and one has died.
41 are imported cases, 28 are locally-transmitted cases and for the remaining case the source of infection
is unclear.

•

There are currently 1,447 Patients Under Investigation (PUIs), this number includes people being treated
for other conditions who are no longer suspected of having COVID-19 infection.

ANALYSIS
On 11th March, 2020, the Director General of WHO announced that the current status of the COVID-19 event
can be characterized as a pandemic. However, this announcement does not change the World Health
Organization’s assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It also doesn’t change the work that WHO is doing
to assist the Government of Thailand and in countries across the globe. Characterizing this event as a pandemic
also does not change the approach we should take:
•
•
•

Stop transmission and prevent spread of this virus by finding, isolating, treating every case and tracing every
close contact
Communicate relentlessly with all people – about the risks and how they can protect themselves
Prepare hospitals: train and protect health care workers.

Contract tracing is a critical step in stopping transmission of coronavirus. After a COVID-19 case is confirmed,
public health officials will identify all persons who have been in close contact with the case since the case
became sick. Close contacts are usually persons who have been in repeated, close proximity with the case –
family members, intimate partners, co-workers sharing the same office space, close friends, caregivers. All
contacts are monitored daily for 14 days. Should contacts develop symptoms, contact tracing ensures that they
are identified quickly and isolated, so that they do not continue to pass the virus to others. In this way, the
transmission from person to person may be broken.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including by the
virus causing COVID-19, include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance,
cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals,
especially in emergency departments.

Advice from WHO on cleaning practices and the survivability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces & in different
settings, available here.
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of
respiratory illness either during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share
their travel history with their healthcare provider.

MEDIA
•
•

WHO Thailand continues to receive media queries about the outbreak and through its website provides
relevant content on a regular basis to the public and other constituencies. Media queries can be directed to
sethawebmaster@who.int and risleyp@who.int
WHO Thailand’s Twitter and Facebook accounts post useful information on hygiene and protection, such
as when and how to use masks, as well as relevant WHO technical guidelines and other content related to
the novel coronavirus situation in Thailand and globally.

WHO THAILAND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO Thailand’s strategic objectives to support Thailand’s response are to:
•
•
•

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further spread within
as well as to and from Thailand i;
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment

•
•

options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; and
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing
•
•
•
•
•
•

Thailand has strong capacities for case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis,
clinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication.
Thailand is also updating its dedicated national pandemic influenza preparedness plan (pending approval
by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet).
With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested.
The Health Ministry is conducting modelling exercises with the National Research Council of Thailand to
forecast possible scenarios and outcomes as the outbreak evolves in Thailand.
Visitors to Thailand traveling from affected areas are being screened and provided information upon arrival
by the Ministry of Public Health, including how to report any possible illness to the Department of Disease
Control using the 1422 hotline.
The Ministry has also introduced a self-reporting online tool, available in Thai, English and Chinese, which
can be accessed here.

What WHO is doing in Thailand

the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health
measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication
