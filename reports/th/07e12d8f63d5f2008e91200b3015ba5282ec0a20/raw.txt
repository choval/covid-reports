HIGHLIGHTS
• On the 30th of March 2020, 136 new cases of laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 were announced by the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand,
bringing the total number of cases to 1,524.
• Most newly reported cases are related to previously reported clusters;
others have returned from abroad or had occupational exposure to large
numbers of people (spa, hotel, restaurant, shops).
• A majority of cases have been male and many are in the 20-49 age group.
This is likely because so many cases are linked to boxing stadiums, entertainment venues and to the
Dakwah Pilgimage.
• Of the 23 severe cases, more than half are over 60 years old and have underlying conditions. The latest
two fatal cases are a man aged 54 (from Yala) and a woman aged 51 (from Bangkok). Neither case had
underlying conditions and both sought care early.
• The underlying conditions found among cases who are receiving treatment include hypertension, diabetes,
kidney disease and cancer. The Ministry of Public Health has requested younger people returning to their
home towns to self-quarantine to protect vulnerable older people, and strongly encourages older adults who
develop respiratory symptoms and fever to immediately seek care.
• 59 of the 76 provinces have now reported cases.

ANALYSIS
The proportion of COVID-19 cases detected outside of Bangkok is increasing. Cases have now been reported
in 77% of Thailand’s provinces. Sub-national public health capacity is robust, including extensive networks of
Rapid Response Teams and Village Health Volunteers. These networks will work to identify suspected cases,
ensure they are quickly isolated from others, treat them and trace and quarantine their close contacts. Rapidly
separating infected persons from others minimizes opportunities for spread of the virus and is effective in
preventing disease in the population. The goal is to interrupt spread and contain COVID-19 in every affected
Province.
Everyone can play their part by staying at home, maintaining 1.5 meters distance from others if they must go
out, washing hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer, avoiding touching the mouth
and nose, and observing respiratory hygiene (coughing into flexed elbow or a tissue which is disposed of safely).
Anyone who has recently travelled to any province from Bangkok in the past 14 days, and who develops
symptoms of COVID-19, should separate themselves from others, wear a mask and seek medical attention
immediately.
ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
• Remain inside your home. Leave your home only for essential activities (e.g. medical care, purchase food).
• Always try to maintain a distance of at least 1.5 meters from all other persons.
• Wash your hands frequently. An alcohol-based hand rub is also effective
• Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
• If unwell, wear a mask. Do not use N95 respirators as supplies are limited and they are critically needed for
healthcare workers.
• Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a clean tissue. Dispose of tissues immediately and wash your hands.
• Do not shake hands, embrace, share eating utensils or smoking devices with other people.
• Keep all commonly touched surfaces clean. Advice on cleaning practices and the survivability of the SARS-
CoV-2 virus on surfaces & in different settings is available here.
