RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
The Governors of Bangkok, five neighboring provinces and Chiang Mai have imposed urgent measures to
ensure social distancing, including closing a range of retail business until at least April 12th. People living in
these areas are requested to remain inside their homes and to limit all social contacts. The MOPH has urged
workers of retail businesses in Bangkok not to travel to their hometowns in order to prevent the spread of
coronavirus to their families. The National Communicable Disease Committee has asked all Provincial
Governors to develop action plans for screening, case- finding and disease prevention measures at the
district and sub-district levels. Some provinces are seeing their first cases. Testing, isolating positive cases
and tracing their contacts to limit ongoing transmission of the virus, is an essential public health response at
this moment. These activities, combined with strict social distancing measures, are the best tools currently
available to combat the pandemic.
To reduce the risk of contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 observe the following:
• Remain inside your home. Leave your home only for essential activities (e.g. to seek medical care or to
purchase food).
• Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from all other persons at all times.
• Frequently wash your hands, especially after any contact with ill people or their environment. An alcohol-
based hand rub is also effective
• Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
• If unwell, wear a cloth or paper mask. Do not use N95 respirators as supplies are limited and they are
critically needed for healthcare workers.
• Cover coughs & sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing and frequently wash your hands.
• Do not shake hands, embrace, share eating utensils or smoking devices with other people.
• Avoid contact with people suffering any symptoms of acute respiratory infection.
• Keep all commonly touched surfaces in your home clean.
MEDIA
• WHO Thailand continues to receive media queries about the outbreak and through its website provides
relevant content on a regular basis to the public and other constituencies. Media queries can be directed to

as when and how to use masks, as well as relevant WHO technical guidelines and other content related to
the novel coronavirus situation in Thailand and globally.
