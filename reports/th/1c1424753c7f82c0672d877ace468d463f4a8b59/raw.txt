1,421 persons under
hospital and one has died. One patient remains severely unwell.
Investigation / treatment
The number of PUIs currently stands at 3,252 (299 more than yesterday).
The relatively large increase in these numbers reflects changes in the
case definition made to try and identify more suspected cases. In total, 1,421 PUIs are under
treatment/investigation; this number includes people being treated for other conditions who are no longer
suspected of having COVID-19 infection.
The Ministry list of COVID-19-affected countries or areas now includes: China, France (new), Germany
(new), Hong Kong SAR, Iran (Islamic Republic), Italy, Japan, Macau SAR, Republic of Korea, Singapore
and Taipei and environs. Information on what this means for people who recently arrived in Thailand from
these countries, or who may be planning to travel from these countries to Thailand can be found here
WHO reiterates that health screening and surveillance systems in Thailand – at points of entry into the
country as well as nationwide - are robust and capable of tracking suspected cases quickly, allowing health
authorities to implement protocols to ensure isolation, contact tracing, testing and treatment of symptoms.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including by the
virus causing COVID-19, include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance,
cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals,
especially in emergency departments.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of
respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share
their travel history with their healthcare provider.

WHO THAILAND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
WHO Thailand’s strategic objectives to support Thailand’s response are to:
•
•
•
•
•

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further spread within as
well as to and from Thailand i;
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; and
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
What Thailand is doing
•
•
•

Thailand has strong capacities for case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis,
clinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication.
Thailand also recently updated its dedicated national pandemic influenza preparedness plan (currently
pending approval by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet).
With WHO support, the National Institute of Health of Thailand is supporting specimen testing for other
countries as requested.
