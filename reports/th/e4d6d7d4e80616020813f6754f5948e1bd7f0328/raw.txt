MITIGATING THE IMPACT ON
SOCIETY
Mental Health
Surveys conducted by the Department of Mental
Health (DMH) in the Ministry of Public Health show a
high percentage of respondents who report having
raised levels of stress, especially health care workers.
Stress is a normal reaction to the COVID-19 situation
and may affect groups differently, including the
general public, people who are quarantined,
healthcare workers and those at risk of mental health
problems
The Ministry of Public Health encourages people
suffering from stress to seek help from counsellors at
their hospitals or through their mental health hotline
services #1323
The Department of Mental Health is providing support
to the public, including;
• A mobile application ‘Mental Health Check Up’ for
self-assessment of stress level
• Phone calls to the general public to assess stress
levels and provide support
• A mental health programme ‘Baan Pa lang Jai’ on
Sundays (via ThaiPBS channel)
• An on-line concert (scheduled for 25th April, from
10.00-18.00hrs.)
• Engaging celebrities to communicate with the
public.
ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
What who is doing to provide support to Thailand
WHO Thailand is in frequent direct contact with the
Royal Thai Government through the Ministry of Public
Health, sharing information on key developments,
guidelines and scientific updates.
WHO supports the wider UN response, including
working with key partners and the Ministry of Public
Health to support migrant populations in Thailand.
WHO also provides information and advice to staff of
the UN system in Thailand.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be the top – and
sometimes the only – story in media, it is easy to be
overwhelmed by the constant barrage of information from
around the world.
It is only natural to feel anxious and concerned as we try to
process all this information.
It is important to manage both the amount and quality of
information you consume.
Set one or two specific times of the day to get information
about the outbreak and ensure it is from a trusted and
reliable source such as the WHO or your local health
authority.
Fight your fears by learning the facts. WHO’s Mythbusters
series is a great resource which will help you to sort the facts
from fiction.
Media
WHO Thailand’s website, Twitter and Facebook accounts,
regularly provide content on all aspects of the
outbreak in Thailand and around the world. Media
queries can be directed to sethawebmaster@who.int
