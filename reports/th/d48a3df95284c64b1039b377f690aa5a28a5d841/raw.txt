HIGHLIGHTS
• On the 21st
of April 2020, 19 new cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were announced by the Ministry of
Public Health of Thailand, bringing the total number of cases to 2,811.
• Of these, 75% (2,108) have recovered, about 1.7% (48) have died, and 23% (655) are receiving treatment.
• Only one case was identified in a person returning from outside Thailand; likely reflecting restrictions on
entry.
• Ten of the new cases
are close contacts of
previously confirmed
cases. Two cases
attended crowded
places.
• To date, 68 of the total
77 provinces have
reported cases. 35 of
these 68 provinces
have not reported any
new cases during the
past 14 days. The three
provinces that have
reported the most
cases are Bangkok
(1,447), Phuket (193)
and Nonthaburi (152).
Nine provinces have not reported any cases.
UPDATE FROM THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH
At present, the Ministry of Public Health is focusing efforts on:
• Rapid contact tracing
• Active case finding in groups who have higher risks, including low-skilled labourers.
• Active case finding in areas where transmission is ongoing, such as Bangkok and Phuket
• Strengthening Infection Prevention and Control in health facilities: guidance and standards have been
disseminated, including screening/triage of all patients at the point of entry, and managing groups of HCWs
to minimize the risk of cross-over infections between teams.
Laboratory testing:
• From February until 17th
April, 142,589 samples have been tested, the majority through private hospitals.
• From 4th
– 17th
April, an average of 3,300 samples were tested per day and the percentage of positive cases
varied between 1.41 and 3.82.
• The utility of saliva testing is being explored in order to reduce the risk of infection to healthcare staff in
collecting nasopharyngeal swabs. This study is supported by the Ministry of Public Health in collaboration
with Ramathibodi Hospital, Chulalongkorn Hospital and Siriraj Hospital.
