* SARS-CoV-2 related deaths presented in this report are those occurring in patients who test positive for
SARS-CoV-2RT by PCR, independently from pre-existing diseases.
2. Demographics
Mean age of patients dying for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 79 years (median 80, range 5-100, IQR 73 -86).
Women were 6,339 (34.0%). Figure 1 shows that median age of patients dying for SARS-CoV-2 infection was
more than 15 years higher as compared with the national sample diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection
(median age 62 years). Figure 2 shows the absolute number of deaths by age group. Women dying for
SARS-CoV-2 infection had an older age than men (median age women 83 - median age men 79).

3. Pre-existing conditions
Table 1 presents most common comorbidities diagnosed before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data on diseases
were based on chart review and was available on 1,596 patients dying in-hospital for whom it was possible
to analyse clinic charts. Mean number of diseases was 3.3 (median 3, SD 1.9). Overall, 3.3% of the sample
presented with a no comorbidities, 14.5% with a single comorbidity, 20.7% with 2, and 61.5% with 3 or
more.
Before hospitalization, 25% of SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased patients followed ACE-inhibitor therapy and
16% angiotensin receptor blockers-ARBs therapy. This information can be underestimated because data on
drug treatment before admission were not always described in the chart.

Table 3 presents the most common pre-existing chronic pathologies in patients who died, separately in men
(n = 1,088) and women (n = 508). The average number of pathologies observed in women is 3.4 (median 3,
Standard Deviation 1.9). In men the average number of pathologies observed is 3.3 (median 3, Standard
Deviation 1.9).

4. Diagnosis of hospitalization
In 93.0% of hospitalizations, conditions (e.g. pneumonia, respiratory failure) or symptoms (e.g. fever,
dyspnoea, cough) compatible with SARS-CoV-2 were mentioned. In 107 cases (7.0% of cases) the diagnosis
of hospitalization was not related to the infection. In 9 cases the diagnosis of hospitalization concerned
exclusively neoplastic pathologies, in 49 cases cardiovascular pathologies (for example Acute Myocardial
Infarction-AMI, heart failure, stroke), in 14 cases gastrointestinal pathologies (for example cholecystitis,
perforation of the intestine, intestinal obstruction, cirrhosis), in 35 cases other pathologies.
5. Symptoms
Figure 3 shows symptoms most commonly observed at hospital admission. Fever, dyspnoea and cough
were the most commonly observed symptoms, while diarrhoea and haemoptysis were less commonly
observed. Overall, 5.7% of patients did not present any symptoms at hospital admission.

6. Acute conditions
Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome was observed in the majority of patients (96.8% of cases),
followed by acute renal failure (23.0%). Superinfection was observed in 11.6% and acute cardiac injury in
9.5% of cases.
7. Treatments
Antibiotics were used by 84% of patients during hospital stay, while less used were antivirals (56%) and
corticosteroids (34%). Concomitant use of these 3 treatments was observed in 19.3% of cases.
Out of SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased patients, 3.1% were treated with Tocilizumab during hospitalization.

Figure 4 shows, for SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased patients, the median times, in days, from the onset of
symptoms to death (10 days), from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization (5 days) and from
hospitalization to death (5 days). The time from hospitalization to death was 4 days longer in those who
were transferred to intensive care than those who were not transferred (8 days vs. 4 days).

9. Deaths under the age of 50 years
As of April 13th
, 217 out of the 18,641 (1.2%) positive SARS-CoV-2 patients under the age of 50 died. In
particular, 47 of these were less than 40 years (32 men and 15 women), age range between 5 and 39
years. For 6 patients under the age of 40 years no clinical information is available; the remaining 33 had
serious pre-existing pathologies (cardiovascular, renal, psychiatric pathologies, diabetes, obesity) and 8
had no major pathologies.
