SARSCoV-2 RT by PCR, independently from pre-existing diseases.
2. Demographics
Mean age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection was 78 (median 79, range 26-100, IQR 73 -85).
Women were 3,088 (30.8%). Figure 1 shows that median age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection
was more than 15 years higher as compared with the national sample diagnosed with COVID-2019 infection
(median age 62 years). Figure 2 shows the absolute number of deaths by age group. Women dying for
COVID-2019 infection had an older age than men (median age women 82 - median age men 78).

3. Pre-existing conditions
Table 1 presents most common comorbidities diagnosed before COVID-2019 infection. Data on diseases
were based on chart review and was available on 909 patients dying in-hospital for whom it was possible to
analyse clinic charts. Mean number of diseases was 2.7 (median 3, SD 1.6). Overall, 2.1% of the sample
presented with a no comorbidities, 21.6% with a single comorbidity, 24.5% with 2, and 51.7% with 3 or
more.
Before hospitalization, 28% of COVID-19 positive deceased patients followed ACE-inhibitor therapy and 16%
angiotensin receptor blockers-ARBs therapy. This information can be underestimated because data on drug
treatment before admission were not always described in the chart.

4. Diagnosis of hospitalization
In 94.9% of hospitalizations, conditions (e.g. pneumonia, respiratory failure) or symptoms (e.g. fever,
dyspnoea, cough) compatible with COVID-19 were mentioned. In 46 cases (5.1% of cases) the diagnosis of
hospitalization was not related to the infection. In 7 cases the diagnosis of hospitalization concerned
exclusively neoplastic pathologies, in 18 cases cardiovascular pathologies (for example IMA, heart failure,
stroke), in 11 cases gastrointestinal pathologies (for example cholecystitis, perforation of the intestine,
intestinal obstruction, cirrhosis), in 10 cases other pathologies.
5. Symptoms
Figure 3 shows symptoms most commonly observed at hospital admission. Fever, dyspnoea and cough
were the most commonly observed symptoms, while diarrhoea and haemoptysis were less commonly
observed. Overall, 6.0% of patients did not present any symptoms at hospital admission.

6. Acute conditions
Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome was observed in the majority of patients (96.5% of cases),
followed by acute renal failure (25.7%). Acute cardiac injury was observed in 11.6% and Superinfection in
11.2% of cases.
7. Treatments
Antibiotics were used by 86% of patients during hospital stay, while less used were antivirals (54%) and
corticosteroids (34%). Concomitant use of these 3 treatments was observed in 19.3% of cases.
Out of COVID-19 positive deceased patients, 1.7% were treated with Tocilizumab during hospitalization.

Figure 4 shows, for COVID-19 positive deceased patients, the median times, in days, from the onset of
symptoms to death (9 days), from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization (4 days) and from
hospitalization to death (5 days). The time from hospitalization to death was 2 days longer in those who
were transferred to intensive care than those who were not transferred (6 days vs. 4 days).

9. Deaths under the age of 50 years
As of March 30th
, 112 out of the 10,026 (1.1%) positive COVID-19 patients under the age of 50 died. In
particular, 23 of these were less than 40 years, 19 men and 4 women (age range between 26 and 39
years). For 2 patients under the age of 40 years no clinical information is available; the remaining 15 had
serious pre-existing pathologies (cardiovascular, renal, psychiatric pathologies, diabetes, obesity) and 6
had no major pathologies.
