Mean age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection was 78 (median 78, range 30-103, IQR 73 -85).
Women were 1,615 (29.1%). Figure 1 shows that median age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection
was more than 15 years higher as compared with the national sample diagnosed with COVID-2019 infection

Table 1 presents most common comorbidities diagnosed before COVID-2019 infection. Data on diseases
were based on chart review and was available on 514 patients dying in-hospital for whom it was possible to
analyse clinic charts (15.0% of the sample). Mean number of diseases was 2.7 (median 3, SD 1.6). Overall,
1.4% of the sample presented with a no comorbidities, 21.4% with a single comorbidity, 26.1% with 2, and
51.2% with 3 or more.

Figure 4 shows, for COVID-19 positive deceased patients, the median times, in days, from the onset of
symptoms to death (9 days), from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization (4 days) and from
hospitalization to death (5 days). The time from hospitalization to death was 1 day longer in those who
were transferred to intensive care than those who were not transferred (5 days vs. 4 days).
