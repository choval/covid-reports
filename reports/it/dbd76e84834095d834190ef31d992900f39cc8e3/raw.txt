SARSCoV-2 RT by PCR, independently from pre-existing diseases.
2. Demographics
Mean age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection was 78.5 (median 80, range 31-103, IQR 73 -85).
Women were 942 (29.4%). Figure 1 shows that median age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection was
more than 15 years higher as compared with the national sample diagnosed with COVID-2019 infection
(median age 63 years). Figure 2 shows the absolute number of deaths by age group. Women dying for
COVID-2019 infection had an older age than men (median age women 82 - median age men 79).

3. Pre-existing conditions
Table 1 presents most common comorbidities diagnosed before COVID-2019 infection. Data on diseases
were based on chart review and was available on 481/3200 patients dying in-hospital (15.0% of the
sample). Mean number of diseases was 2.7 (median 2, SD 1.6). Overall, 1.2% of the sample presented with
a no comorbidities, 23.5% with a single comorbidity, 26.6% with 2, and 48.6% with 3 or more.

4. Symptoms
Figure 3 shows symptoms most commonly observed at hospital admission. Fever and dyspnoea were the
most commonly observed symptoms, while cough, diarrhoea and haemoptysis were less commonly
observed. Overall, 5.7% of patients did not present any symptoms at hospital admission.

5. Acute conditions
Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome was observed in the majority of patients (96.5% of cases),
followed by acute renal failure (29.2%). Acute cardiac injury was observed in 10.4% of cases and
superinfection in 8.5%.
6. Treatments
Antibiotics were used by 84% of patients during hospital stay, while less used were antivirals (54%) and
corticosteroids (31%). Concomitant use of these 3 treatments was observed in 18.6% of cases.
Before hospitalization, 36% of COVID-19 positive deceased patients followed ACE-inhibitor therapy and
16% angiotensin receptor blockers-ARBs therapy. This information can be underestimated because data
on drug treatment before admission were not always described in the chart.

Figure 4 shows, for COVID-19 positive deceased patients, the median times, in days, from the onset of
symptoms to death (8 days), from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization (4 days) and from
hospitalization to death (4 days). The time from hospitalization to death was 1 day longer in those who
were transferred to intensive care than those who were not transferred (5 days vs. 4 days).

8. Deaths under the age of 50 years
To date (March the 20th
), 36 of 3200 (1.1%) COVID-19 positive patients under the age of 50 have died. In
particular, 9 of these were younger than 40 years, 8 men and 1 woman (age range between 31 and 39
years). For 2 patients under the age of 40 years, no clinical information is available; the remaining 7 had
