SARSCoV-2 RT by PCR, independently from pre-existing diseases.
2. Demographics
Mean age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection was 78 (median 79, range 30-100, IQR 73 -85).
Women were 2,012 (29.6%). Figure 1 shows that median age of patients dying for COVID-2019 infection
was more than 15 years higher as compared with the national sample diagnosed with COVID-2019 infection
(median age 63 years). Figure 2 shows the absolute number of deaths by age group. Women dying for
COVID-2019 infection had an older age than men (median age women 82 - median age men 78).

3. Pre-existing conditions
Table 1 presents most common comorbidities diagnosed before COVID-2019 infection. Data on diseases
were based on chart review and was available on 710 patients dying in-hospital for whom it was possible to
analyse clinic charts. Mean number of diseases was 2.7 (median 3, SD 1.6). Overall, 2.1% of the sample
presented with a no comorbidities, 21.3% with a single comorbidity, 25.9% with 2, and 50.7% with 3 or
more.
Before hospitalization, 30% of COVID-19 positive deceased patients followed ACE-inhibitor therapy and 17%
angiotensin receptor blockers-ARBs therapy. This information can be underestimated because data on drug
treatment before admission were not always described in the chart.

10.1% of cases.
6. Treatments

Figure 4 shows, for COVID-19 positive deceased patients, the median times, in days, from the onset of
symptoms to death (9 days), from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization (4 days) and from
hospitalization to death (5 days). The time from hospitalization to death was 2 days longer in those who
were transferred to intensive care than those who were not transferred (6 days vs. 4 days).

8. Deaths under the age of 50 years
As of March 26th
, 84 out of the 6801 (1.2%) positive COVID-19 patients under the age of 50 died. In
particular, 17 of these were less than 40 years, 14 men and 3 women (age range between 30 and 39
years). For 5 patients under the age of 40 years no clinical information is available; the remaining 8 had
