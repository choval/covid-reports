CDC on Homemade Cloth Face Coverings
CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other
social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and
pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.
CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of
the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from
transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household
items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an
additional, voluntary public health measure.
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age
2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or
otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance.
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95
respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for
healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by
current CDC guidance.
Should cloth face coverings be washed or otherwise
cleaned regularly? How regularly?
Yes. They should be routinely washed depending on the frequency
of use.
How does one safely sterilize/clean a cloth face covering?
A washing machine should suffice in properly washing a cloth face covering.
How does one safely remove a used cloth face covering?
Individuals should be careful not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth
when removing their cloth face covering and wash hands immediately
after removing.

Sewn Cloth Face Covering
Materials
• Two 10”x6”rectangles of cotton fabric
• Two 6”pieces of elastic
(or rubber bands, string,
cloth strips, or hair ties)
• Needle and thread (or bobby pin)
• Scissors
• Sewing machine
3. Run a 6-inch length of 1/8-inch wide elastic through the wider hem
on each side of the cloth face covering.These will be the ear loops.
Use a large needle or a bobby pin to thread it through.Tie the ends
tight.
Don’t have elastic? Use hair ties or elastic head bands. If you only
have string, you can make the ties longer and tie the cloth face
covering behind your head.
4. Gently pull on the elastic so that the knots
are tucked inside the hem.
Gather the sides of the cloth face covering
on the elastic and adjust so the cloth face
covering fits your face. Then securely stitch
the elastic in place to keep it from slipping.
Tutorial
1. Cut out two 10-by-6-inch rectangles of cotton
fabric. Use tightly woven cotton, such as quilting
fabric or cotton sheets. T-shirt fabric will work in
a pinch. Stack the two rectangles; you will sew
the cloth face covering as if it was a single piece
of fabric.
2. Fold over the long sides ¼ inch and hem. Then fold the
double layer of fabric over ½ inch along the short sides
and stitch down.
