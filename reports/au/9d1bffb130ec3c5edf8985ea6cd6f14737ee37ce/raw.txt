Weekly epidemiological report
COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 12:
Reportingweekending23:59AEST19April2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team
Notified cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths reported to the National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System (NNDSS) to 19 April 2020.
Summary
The reduction in international travel and
domestic movement, social distancing measures
and public health action have likely slowed the
spread of the disease (Figure 1).
Notifications in Australia remain predomi-
nantly among people with recent overseas travel,
with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back
to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable
to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution
of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired
cases varies by jurisdiction.
The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia
remains low (1.0%) compared to the World
Health Organization’s globally-reported rate
(6.8%) and to other comparable high-income
countries such as the United States of America
(4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%). The low
CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertain-
ment including detection of mild cases. High
Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 19 April
2020i
Notifications 6,606
Deaths 69
case ascertainment and prompt identification of
contacts enables the public health response and
a reduction of disease transmission.
Internationally, cases continue to increase. The
rates of increase have started to slow in several
regions, although it is too soon to tell whether
this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of
international epidemiology should be conducted
with caution as it differs from country to coun-
try depending not only on the disease dynamics,
but also on differences in case detection, testing
and implemented public health measures.

Australian cases: descriptive
epidemiology
National trends
For the week ending 19 April 2020, there were
212 cases of COVID-19 notified to the NNDSS,
bringing the total number of confirmed cases
notified in Australia to 6,606 (as of 23:59 AEST
19 April 2020).
The number of new cases continues to decrease
(Table 1) which indicates a reduction in disease
transmission, as demonstrated by a flattening of
the cumulative cases curve. While the reduction
in international travel has decreased the number
of imported cases, the public health response
(such as social distancing measures) remains
important in continuing to limit domestic
transmission.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
persons
Forty-seven cases (0.7%) have been reported in
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons
since the start of the outbreak. These cases were
reported across several jurisdictions, with the
majority reported in areas classified as ‘major
cities of Australia’ based on the case’s usual
place of residence (Table 2). No cases have been
notified from remote or very remote Australia.
Across all Australian cases, completeness of the
Indigenous status field was approximately 92%.
Fifty-five percent (n = 26) of cases in Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander persons have acquired
their infection overseas, with 36% (n = 17) of
cases acquired domestically. Four cases (9%) are
still under investigation.
The median age of COVID-19 cases among
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons
was 36 years (interquartile range: 23.5–56.8
years), which is lower than the median age of
non-Indigenous COVID-19 cases.
Of the cases notified amongst Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander persons, 10% were admit-
ted to hospital, with no such cases reported as
being admitted to ICU. This is less than the
proportion of cases hospitalised from the non-
Indigenous population.

Geographical distribution
During the reporting week, cases of COVID-19
were reported from all jurisdictions except the
Northern Territory and the ACT (Table 3). New
South Wales and Tasmania had the highest year-
to-date rate of COVID-19 notifications (37.1 and
38.1 per 100,000 respectively) and the Northern
Territory had the lowest (10.9 per 100,000). The
majority of new cases over this past week con-
tinue to have been reported in New South Wales
and Victoria.
Compared to the previous reporting week, the
number of new cases in the current reporting
period decreased in all jurisdictions except the
Northern Territory which reported no new cases
in either reporting week.
Outside of Tasmania, most cases over the past
fornight were reported to reside in major metro-
politan areas. (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
Age and gender distribution
Cases of COVID-19 were reported across all age
groups. The median age of all COVID-19 cases
was 48 years (interquartile range, IQR: 30–62
years) (Figure 4).
The median ages of hospitalisation (median:
60.5, IQR: 42–72 years) and death (median: 79,
IQR: 74–84) were higher than for cases overall.
This is consistent with international reporting
and reflects a greater risk of severe disease, com-
plications and deaths in the elderly and those
with comorbidities (Table 4 and Figure 4).
The number of cases was highest in the 20–29
years age group; a high proportion have reported
recent overseas travel history. The highest rate of
disease was among those in the 60–69 years age
group, followed closely by the 70–79 years age
group (Figure 5). The high rate amongst those
in the 60–69 and 70–79 years age group may be
linked to outbreaks on cruise ships, with 28.3%
of cases in the 60–69 years age group and 42.0%
in the 70–79 years age group acquiring their
infection at sea.
Children make up a very small proportion of
cases nationally, with 1% of cases aged less than
10 years and 3% aged 10–19 years. One hundred
and fifty-six cases were school-aged children
aged 5–18 years. This is consistent with inter-
national studies which suggest that children are
not a primary driver of transmission.

a Based on diagnosis date from NNDSS reporting period up to 23:59 AEST 19 April 2020.
Notifications by gender were approximately
equal in most jurisdictions except the ACT and
Tasmania. Among cases reported in the ACT,
there were slightly more males than females;
among cases reported in Tasmania, there were
slightly more females than males.
Notifications by gender differed by age group
with a higher rate of disease in females in the
20–29 age group and a higher rate of disease in
males in those aged over 60. It is unlikely that
this disparity reflects differences in underlying
susceptibility to COVID-19, instead it is more
likely linked to transmission and possibly differ-
ences in behavioural patterns.
Source of infection
The incidence rate of overseas-acquired COVID-
19 cases in Australia has decreased in the last
three weeks. The rate of locally acquired cases
has also decreased (Table 5).
Of cases with a reported place of acquisition,
64% had a recent international travel history
and 25% were considered to have been locally
acquired (Figure 6):
• The majority of overseas-acquired cases
continue to report a travel history to the
European Region, the Americas Region or on
board cruise ships (Figure 7);
• Of the locally-acquired cases, most were con-
sidered to be contacts of a confirmed case,
with a very small proportion of cases not able
to be epidemiologically linked to a confirmed
case; and
• Cases where a place of acquisition has not
been reported (0.9%) are currently under
public health investigation.

Cluster:
• The term ‘cluster’ in relation to COVID-19 refers to two or more cases (who do not reside in
the same household) that are epidemiologically related in time, place or person where a com-
mon source (such as an event or within a community) of infection is suspected but not yet
established.
Outbreak:
• The term ‘outbreak’ in relation to COVID-19 refers to two or more cases (who do not reside
in the same household) among a specific group of people and/or over a specific period of
time where illness is associated with a common source (such as an event or within a commu-
nity).
Cluster and outbreak investigations
Investigations are taking place in states and ter-
ritories in relation to a number of clusters and
outbreaks of COVID-19. To date the largest out-
breaks have been associated with cruise ships,
with some other large domestic clusters associ-
ated with aged care and healthcare facilities and
private functions, such as weddings.
Cruise ships account for a substantial propor-
tion of cases of COVID-19 in Australia. Of
cases with a reported place of acquisition, 18%
were acquired at sea on a cruise ship. This is an
8% increase in COVID-19 cases acquired on a
cruise ship since the last reporting period. There
have been 22 deaths in Australia among cases
acquired on cruise ships.
Residents of aged care facilities are at increased
risk of COVID-19 infection due to the environ-
ment of communal living facilities. These resi-
dents are more vulnerable to serious complica-
tions if they do become infected. As of 19 April
2020, there have been 90 cases of COVID-19
associated with 24 residential aged care facilities
in Australia, with 20 recoveries and 11 deaths.
Fifty-three of these cases occurred in aged care
residents; the remaining 37 cases were in care
staff. In addition, there have been 34 cases asso-
ciated with 24 in-home Commonwealth funded
aged care services providing support to older
Australians who live at home, with 6 recoveries
and 1 death. Twenty-five of these cases occurred
in care recipients; the remaining nine cases were
in care staff. Advice and guidelines have been
provided to aged care services, including the
release of an outbreak management guide.
There have been instances of COVID-19 out-
breaks occurring in Australian healthcare set-
tings. The outbreak of COVID-19 in hospitals in
north-west Tasmania began in late March 2020.
Cases occurred among healthcare workers,
patients and household contacts. As of 20 April
2020, there were 112 persons associated with
the outbreak, including 72 staff members. The
outbreak resulted in widespread quarantine of
healthcare workers, patients and visitors to the
affected hospitals. Investigations into the out-
break are continuing.
Symptom profile
Of the symptoms reported, cough (70%) was the
most common (Figure 8). Forty-eight percent of
cases reported fever, 40% reported sore throat,
and 36% reported headache. Only 4% or fewer of
all cases reported either pneumonia or acute res-
piratory disease (ARD). In addition, loss of taste
was reported from 494 cases and loss of smell
from 526 cases. These conditions were reported
in approximately 11% of cases, noting that this is
currently not a standard field in NNDSS, and is
likely to under-represent those presenting with
these symptoms.

Severity
Of total cases of COVID-19 (n = 6,606) notified,
810 (12%) were admitted to hospital. This is sub-
stantially less than the proportion of diagnosed
cases requiring hospitalisation reported from
EU/EEA countries (32%).1
The median age of
hospitalised cases was 60.5 years (interquartile
range: 42–72 years), with the highest proportion
of hospitalised cases in the 60–69 years and
70–79 years age groups. The most commonly
reported comorbid conditions among hospital-
ised cases were cardiac disease, diabetes (each
19%) and chronic respiratory condition (14%).
Obesity was reported as a comorbid condition
by 8% (n=41) of hospitalised cases.
Of the hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 17% (n
= 141) were admitted to an intensive care unit
(ICU), with 39 cases receiving ventilation. The
most commonly reported comorbid conditions
among cases admitted to an ICU were diabetes
(24%) and cardiac disease (22%), which is simi-
lar to those reported among hospitalised cases.
However, a greater proportion of cases admitted
to an ICU and receiving ventilation reported
being obese (15% and 26% respectively).
The median time between onset of symptoms
and laboratory testing was 2 days (IQR: 1–4
days).
Sixty-nine COVID-19 associated deaths were
confirmed in Australia up to 19 April 2020.
The median age of cases who died was 79 years
(IQR: 74–84 years). Forty-two of the cases were
male and 27 were female. The most commonly
reported comorbid conditions among COVID-
19 deaths were diabetes (33%), cardiac disease
(27%) and chronic respiratory disease (24%).

Public health response
Since COVID-19 first emerged internationally,
Australia has implemented public health meas-
ures in response to the disease’s epidemiology,
both overseas and in Australia. These measures
are focused on restrictions on domestic and
international travel and public gatherings; pri-
orities for testing and quarantining of suspected
cases and close contacts; guidance on effective
social distancing; and the protection of vulner-
able populations such as those in residential
care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander communities. Key aspects of
Australia’s evolving public health response are
summarised in Table 7.
During the current reporting period, the
Australian Health Protection Principal
Committee (AHPPC) has issued advice to
inform the national public health response to
the pandemic including practical guidance
and advice for school leaders engaging with
children, parents, teachers, and support staff
to reduce even further the relatively low risk of
COVID-19 transmission in schools. AHPPC has
also released a statement on the next phase of
modelling to better understand the present state
of the epidemic, and to define the effectiveness
of current public health interventions in reduc-
ing COVID-19 transmission to shape future
decisions on response strategies.5
International situation6
As at 23:59 AEST 19 April 2020, the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) was
2,241,359 globally. COVID-19 was reported
across a total of 216 countries, territories and
areas.
The number of new cases reported globally
increased by 76% since last week. This is an
increase by 26% on the previous week’s number
of new cases.
The reported epidemiology varies by country,
with different trajectories of outbreaks after
their first 100 cases. Figure 9 highlights that for a
number of countries outside of mainland China
which have reported more than 100 cases, their
rates of increase continue to be high, particu-
larly USA, Spain and Italy, although at a slower
rate than the previous week. For Singapore and
Japan, there continues to be a slow but steady
rate of increase in their number of new cases,
while the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong are
reporting very few new cases each day. Reported
case numbers will be influenced by rates of test-
ing, case definition, and case detection as well as
overall health system capacity.
Globally, 152,551 deaths have been reported.
The risk of death is reported to increase with
age. The case fatality rate is reported as 6.8%.
This is highly likely to be an overestimate due to
variable levels of under-ascertainment of cases,
especially those with mild infections and pres-
ence of a comorbid condition such as diabetes,
cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory
disease.
Of all deaths reported globally, approximately
half have been from the USA (21%), Italy (15%)
and Spain (13%). For several other countries or
regions including Japan and Republic of Korea,
there continues to be a slow increase in their
number of deaths, with both countries reporting
few new deaths each day, which is consistent with
their broader epidemic case trends (Figure 10).
The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia
is 1%. This is substantially lower than the global
WHO reported rate of 6.8%. Crude CFR is
reflective not only of disease severity and health
care capability in different countries but also of
case ascertainment. Cases with high severity are
more likely to be detected by public health sur-
veillance and as such can artificially inflate the
reported CFR. Internationally the CFR varies by
country. The low CFR in Australia is likely to be
reflective of high case ascertainment, which fur-
ther enables an effective public health response
so as to control disease spread.

Background
The current estimates on epidemiological param-
eters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.
Transmission
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2
is via droplets and fomites from an infected per-
son to a close contact.7
A virological analysis of
hospitalised cases found active virus replication
in upper respiratory tract tissues, with phar-
yngeal virus shedding during the first week of
symptoms. However, current evidence does not
support airborne or faecal-oral spread as major
factors in transmission.
A study in China showed an association between
household contacts and travel with a confirmed
COVID-19 case and an increased risk of infec-
tion.8
A case report of nine COVID-19 patients in
Germany found that RNA viral shedding from
sputum still occurs after symptoms have cleared.
In 50% of the patients, seroconversion occurred
after seven days with a range of up to 14 days;
this seroconversion was not followed by a rapid
decline in viral load.9
However, it is unknown if
detection of viral RNA correlates with shedding
of live virus and transmission risk.
A recent study suggests that children do not
play a key role in household transmission and
are unlikely to be the primary source of house-
hold infections.10
In a population-based study in
Iceland, children under 10 years old had a lower
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults;
6.7% vs. 13.7% in children and adults respec-
tively.11
Incubation period
Estimates of median incubation period, based on
seven published studies, are 5 to 6 days (ranging
from 0 to 14 days). Patients with long incubation
periods do occasionally occur; however, they
are likely to be ‘outliers’ who should be studied
further but are unlikely to represent a change in
epidemiology of the virus.12,13
Molecular epidemiology
Since December 2019, the virus has diversified
into multiple lineages as it has spread globally
with some degree of geographical clustering.
The whole genome sequences currently available
from Australian cases are mostly in returned
travellers from China, the Islamic Republic of
Iran, Europe and the USA, and thereby reflect
this global diversity. Recent work describes an
emerging clade linked to the epidemic in the
Islamic Republic of Iran.14
Clinical features
COVID-19 presents as mild illness in the major-
ity of cases with cough and fever being the most
commonly reported symptoms. Severe or fatal
outcomes are more likely to occur in the elderly
or those with comorbid conditions.7,15
Some COVID-19 patients show neurological
signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting.
There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 viruses are
not always confined to the respiratory tract and
may invade the central nervous system inducing
neurological symptoms. As such, it is possible
that invasion of the central nervous system is
partially responsible for the acute respiratory
failure of COVID-19 patients.16
There is some evidence to suggest that impair-
ment or loss of the sense of smell (hyposmia/
anosmia) or taste (hypoguesia/aguesia) is asso-
ciated with COVID-19.17,18
This is supported by
research finding a biological mechanism for the
SARS-CoV-2 virus to cause olfactory dysfunc-
tion.19,20
Examination of cases and their close contacts in
China found a positive association between age
and time from symptom onset to recovery. The
study also found an association between clini-
cal severity and time from symptom onset to

time to recovery. Compared to people with mild
disease, those with moderate and severe disease
were associated with a 19% and 58% increase in
time to recovery, respectively.8
Several studies have identified cardiovascular
implicationsresultingfromCOVID-19.Vascular
inflammation has been observed in a number
of cases and may be a potential mechanism for
myocardial injury which can result in cardiac
dysfunction and arrhythmias.
Recently published literature outside of Wuhan
found that approximately 10% of all cases devel-
oped gastrointestinal symptoms associated with
COVID-19 infection either on admission or
during hospitalisation.21,22
This number is higher
than the 3% previously reported in Wuhan.
Treatment
CurrentclinicalmanagementofCOVID-19cases
focuses on early recognition, isolation, appropri-
ate infection control measures and provision of
supportive care.23
Whilst there is no specific
antiviral treatment currently recommended for
patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-
CoV-2 infection, multiple clinical trials are
underway to evaluate a number of therapeutic
agents, including remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir,
and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.24
Data considerations
DatawereextractedfromtheNNDSSon21April
2020, by diagnosis date. Due to the dynamic
nature of the NNDSS, data in this extract are
subject to retrospective revision and may vary
from data reported in published NNDSS reports
and reports of notification data by states and
territories.

Appendix A: Frequently asked
questions
Q: Can I request access to the COVID-19 data
behind your CDI weekly reports?
A: National notification data on COVID-19 con-
firmed cases is collated in the National Notifiable
Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) based on
notifications made to state and territory health
authorities under the provisions of their relevant
public health legislation.
Normally, requests for the release of data from the
NNDSS requires agreement from states and ter-
ritories via the Communicable Diseases Network
Australia, and, depending on the sensitivity of the
data sought and proposed, ethics approval may also
be required.
Due to the COVID-19 response, unfortunately, spe-
cific requests for NNDSS data have been put on hold.
We are currently looking into options to be able to
respond to data requests in the near future.
We will continue to publish regular summaries and
analyses of the NNDSS dataset and recommend the
following resources be referred to in the meantime:

Q: Can I request access to data at post-code
level of confirmed cases?
A: Data at this level cannot be released without eth-
ics approval and permission would need to be sought
from all states and territories via the Communicable
Diseases Network Australia. As noted above, specific
requests for NNDSS data are currently on hold.
A GIS/mapping analysis of cases will be included
in each Communicable Diseases Intelligence
COVID-19 weekly epidemiology report. In order to
protect privacy of confirmed cases, data in this map
will be presented at SA3 level.
Q. Where can I find more detailed data on
COVID-19 cases?
A: We are currently looking into ways to provide
more in-depth epidemiological analyses of COVID-
19 cases, with regard to transmission and severity,
including hospitalisation. These analyses will
continue to be built upon in future iterations of
the weekly Communicable Diseases Intelligence
report.
