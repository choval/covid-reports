Weekly epidemiological report

COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 6:
Reporting week ending 1900 AEDT 7 March 2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team

Summary
This is the sixth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia
as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 7 March 2020. It includes data on COVID-19
cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; acute
respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology; Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due to
the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every effort has
been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences between
jurisdictions.

In Australia:
• Seventy-one COVID-19 cases, including two deaths, were notified up until 19:00 AEDT 7
March 2020;
◦◦ Sixteen cases had direct or indirect links to mainland China;
◦◦ Ten cases, including one death, were among the ‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship passengers repatriated from Japan;
◦◦ Sixteen cases had direct or indirect links to the Islamic Republic of Iran;
◦◦ Fourteen had a recent travel history to other countries;
◦◦ Fifteen cases, including one death, had no recent history of overseas travel;
• On 4 March 2020, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) recommended that the current travel restrictions for mainland China and the Islamic Republic of
Iran remain in place for a further seven days; and
• On 5 March 2020, travel restrictions were announced for travellers from Republic of Korea
and enhanced health screening for travellers from Italy.

Internationally:
• 101,927 infections have been confirmed globally, with 3,486 deaths;
• The majority of confirmed infections (79%; n = 80,651) and deaths (88%; n = 3,070) have
been reported in mainland China;
• Outside of mainland China, cases (n = 21,276) have been reported in 96 countries, territories
and areas, with approximately 78% of those cases reported from three countries: Italy, the
Islamic Republic of Iran and Republic of Korea; and
• Outside of mainland China, 416 deaths were reported by 16 countries, territories and areas.

Domestic cases
There were 71 confirmed cases, including two
deaths, reported in Australia as at 19:00 AEDT
7 March 2020 (Table 1). Of the 71 confirmed
cases, 10 (14%) were among the ‘Diamond
Princess’ cruise ship passengers repatriated
from Japan (n = 164) to the Northern Territory
on 20 February 2020. The remaining cases were
reported in New South Wales (n = 33), Victoria
(n = 8), Queensland (n = 12), Western Australia
(n = 1), South Australia (n = 6) and Tasmania (n
= 1) (Figure 1).
Of the 71 confirmed cases, 16 (23%) had direct
or indirect links to mainland China, 10 (14%)
were associated with the ‘Diamond Princess’
cruise ship, 16 (23%) had direct or indirect links
to the Islamic Republic of Iran, 14 (20%) had a
recent travel history to other countries and 15
(21%) had no recent history of overseas travel. Of
the 15 cases who had no recent history of overseas travel, these were all reported in New South
Wales. Twelve of the cases were associated with
an aged care facility, including four residents,
three staff members and several close contacts
outside of the facility. A further two cases were
associated with a workshop and the source of
infection/exposure for the remaining case was
under investigation at the time of writing. The
identification of COVID-19 clusters in New
South Wales with no recent history of overseas

2 of 15

travel in any of the primary/index cases suggests
that there has potentially been some very limited
local transmission within New South Wales.
The median age of all 71 reported Australian
cases was 45 years (range 0–94 years), with the
highest proportion of cases aged 50–59 years
(Table 2). Male-to-female ratio was approximately 1:1. Twenty-two cases have been reported
to have cleared their infections, and two cases
were reported to have died. Of the two cases that
died, both were aged over 65 years.
Of the 71 confirmed cases, 34 (48%) had symptoms recorded. Cough was the most commonly
reported symptom (Table 3) and no cases
reported irritability/confusion, abdominal pain
or acute respiratory disease.

International cases
As at 19:00 AEDT 7 March 2020, the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) was
101,927 globally.1 The proportion of new cases
reported from mainland China has continued to
decrease, from 98% on 22 February 2020 to 79%
(n = 80,651) on 7 March 2020.1,2 On 26 February
2020, the number of new cases outside of
mainland China exceeded the number reported
from mainland China for the first time and this
trend has continued to date (Figure 2). The total
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported
by 96 countries, territories and areas outside of

Country in focus: the Islamic Republic of Iran
Data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Islamic Republic of Iran have not been made publicly
available. The following is therefore a brief summary based on information obtained from WHO
situation reports.
The Islamic Republic of Iran reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 20 February 2020.
From then, reported cases in the Islamic Republic of Iran increased rapidly, from two confirmed
cases on 20 February 2020 to 4,747 on 7 March 2020. Among the cases reported as at 7 March
2020, 30% (n = 1,413) were reported in Tehran, 11% (n = 523) in Qom and 9% (n = 424) in Gilan.
The Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the countries outside of mainland China with the most
rapid growth of COVID-19 cases (Figure 3).
Based on confirmed cases up to 7 March 2020, the case fatality rate (CFR) for the Islamic Republic
of Iran has been calculated at 2.6%. As the outbreak continues, the confirmed CFR may change.
The current calculated CFR does not include the number of cases with mild infections that may
be missed from current surveillance, nor does it account for the recently confirmed cases that
may subsequently develop severe disease and die.

Background
On 31 December 2019, the World Health
Organization (WHO) was notified about a large
number of cases of pneumonia of unknown
origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
Chinese authorities isolated and identified a
novel coronavirus on 7 January 2020.5 WHO
declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.6
From 1 February 2020, Australia denied entry to
anyone who had left or transited through mainland China, with the exception of Australian
citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family and air crew who have been using
appropriate personal protective equipment
(Figure 4).7 The Australian Health Protection
Principal Committee (AHPPC) have reviewed
these restrictions weekly, and on 4 March 2020,
they released a statement recommending current travel restrictions for mainland China and
the Islamic Republic of Iran remain in place for a
further seven days.8 On 5 March 2020, the Prime
Minister announced new travel restrictions for
travellers coming from Republic of Korea, and
implementation of enhanced health screening

health.gov.au/cdi

for arrivals from Italy. From 5 March 2020, foreign nationals (excluding permanent residents
of Australia) will be prevented from coming to
Australia until 14 days after leaving Republic of
Korea.9
The AHPPC acknowledged that Australia’s border measures may no longer be able to prevent
the importation of COVID-19, and the primary
focus should now be directed at domestic containment and preparedness.8 Local transmission of COVID-19 has occurred in Australia,
highlighting the need of effective containment
measures to limit spread. Early isolation of identified cases and quarantine of suspected cases
and close contacts is a key measure to minimise
transmission of COVID-19 in the community.
However, as COVID-19 presents as mild illness
in the majority of cases, early identification and
isolation of cases may be difficult to achieve.
The current estimates on epidemiological parameters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.

Severity
Ongoing evidence, including a recently published meta-analysis, supports previous research
that COVID-19 presents as mild illness in the
majority of cases with fever and cough being
the most commonly reported symptoms.
Severe or fatal outcomes tend to occur in the
elderly or those with comorbid conditions.10,11
Examination of cases and their close contacts
in China found an association between age and
time from symptom onset to recovery. Median
time to recovery was estimated to be 27 days in
20–29 year olds, 32 days in 50–59 year olds, and
36 days in those aged over 70 years. The study
also found an association between clinical severity and time from symptom onset to recovery.
Compared to people with mild disease, those
with moderate and severe disease were associated with a 19% and 58% increase in recovery
time, respectively.12

Transmission
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2
is via droplets and fomites from an infected
person to a close contact.10 Examination of cases
and their close contacts in China supports this.
Household contacts and those who travelled
with a confirmed COVID-19 case were strongly
associated with an increased risk of infection.12
The study also examined the average time
from symptom onset to disease confirmation
and isolation among cases identified through
symptom-based (i.e. symptomatic screening
at airports, community fever monitoring and
testing of hospital patients) and contact-based
(i.e. monitoring and testing of close contacts
of confirmed COVID-19 cases) surveillance.
Compared to cases identified through symptom-based surveillance, cases identified through
contact-based surveillance were associated with
a 2.3 day decrease from symptom onset to disease confirmation, and a 1.9 day decrease from
symptom onset to isolation. Based on modelling,
researchers have found that effective contact
tracing increases the probability of control.12

10 of 15

Current evidence does not support airborne or
faecal-oral spread as major factors in transmission.10

Incubation period
No new research has been published on the
incubation period for COVID-19. Please refer to
COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 4
for the most recently published summary.13

Treatment
Current clinical management of COVID-19
cases focuses on early recognition, isolation,
appropriate infection control measures and
provision of supportive care.14 Whilst there is
no specific antiviral treatment currently recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, multiple clinical
trials are underway to evaluate a number of
therapeutic agents, including remdesivir and
lopinavir/ritonavir.15

Virology
Based on modelling, researchers estimated that
initial human SARS-CoV-2 infection was in
November to early December 2019.16 An analysis
based on 86 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2,
obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing
All Influenza Data (GISAID), found many
mutations.17 This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has
rapidly evolved since the outbreak occurred.
Ongoing surveillance of sequences and shared
mutations will assist with understanding of the
global spread of the virus.

Comparison between COVID-19, SARS
and MERS
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can
cause upper respiratory tract infections in
humans. Coronaviruses can occasionally cause
severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and more recently COVID19. Similar to MERS and SARS, COVID-19 is
thought to have originated from bats, and trans-

mitted to humans via an intermediate animal
host. The intermediate animal host is currently
unknown.18 Table 4 provides an overview of
characteristics of COVID-19, MERS and SARS.

Public health response
The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission
on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
describes some of the key aspects associated
with the evolving outbreak in mainland China,
including the outbreaks transmission dynamics, disease progression and severity, mainland
China’s response and knowledge gaps. As part
of the report, the following major recommendations were made for countries with imported
cases and/or outbreaks of COVID-19:10
1. Immediately activate the highest level of
national Response Management protocols to
ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19
with non-pharmaceutical public health
measures;
2. Prioritise active, exhaustive case finding and
immediate testing and isolation, painstaking
contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of
close contacts;
3. Fully educate the general public on the
seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in
preventing its spread;
4. Immediately expand surveillance to detect
COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias,
conducting screening in some patients with
upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent
COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for
the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance
systems (e.g. systems for influenza-likeillness); and

schools and workplaces).

Methods
Data for this report were current as at 19:00
hours AEDT, 7 March 2020.
This report outlines what is known epidemiologically on COVID-19 in Australia and from
publicly available data from WHO Situation
Reports, other countries’ official updates and
the scientific literature. Data on domestic cases
in this report were collected from the National
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
(NNDSS) and jurisdictional health department
media releases. The Communicable Diseases
Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case
definition for suspect and confirmed cases,
which was modified at different time points
during the outbreak (Table 5). Data was analysed using Stata to describe the epidemiology of
COVID-19 in Australia and the progress of the
epidemic.
Data for the international cases of COVID-19
by country were compiled from the latest WHO
Situation Report. Case definitions may vary by
country making comparisons difficult. Rapid
reviews of the current state of knowledge on
COVID-19 were conducted from the literature
using PubMed.

5. Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and
simulations for the deployment of even more
stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (e.g. the suspension
of large-scale gatherings and the closure of
