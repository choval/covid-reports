Weekly epidemiological report

COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 2
Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 8 February 2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team

Summary
This is the second epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), previously known
as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight
Time [AEDT] 8 February 2020. It includes data on Australian cases notified during the week ending
19:00 AEDT 8 February 2020, the international situation and current information on the severity,
transmission and spread of the COVID-19 infection.
Keywords: novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; acute respiratory disease; case definition;
epidemiology; Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due to
the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every effort has
been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences between
jurisdictions.

In Australia:

from the isolated tour group;

• A total of fifteen cases of COVID-19 infection were notified up until 19:00 AEDT 8
February 2020;

• Zero deaths were reported; and
• Three days elapsed since the onset of illness
in the latest confirmed case at the date of
this report.

• All fifteen cases reported a travel history to
China, and 80% (12/15) had a travel history
to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China;

Internationally:

• All five Queensland cases were in a small
tour group of nine people;

• Case numbers are increasing rapidly with
34,886 infections confirmed globally;

• The three Queensland cases reported this
week are consistent with secondary transmission from the index Queensland case
prior to isolation;

• The majority of confirmed infections
(34,546) were reported in mainland China,
as well as 721 deaths; and

• Isolation and quarantine actions undertaken for the Queensland cases appear to have
successfully prevented further transmission

health.gov.au/cdi

• Two deaths were reported outside mainland
China, one each in Hong Kong and the
Philippines.

Domestic cases
There were fifteen confirmed cases reported
in Australia at 19:00 AEDT 8 February 2020
(Table 1). Cases were reported in New South
Wales (n = 4), Victoria (n = 4), Queensland (n
= 5) and South Australia (n = 2). The first onset
of signs and symptoms in a case occurred on 13
January 2020 (Figure 1). The median age of cases
was 43 (range 8–66) years. The male-to-female
ratio was 1.5:1. 93% of cases (14/15) reported
fever and/or chills and 73% (11/15) reported
cough. Two cases were reported with pneumonia (Figure 2). Approximately 73% (11/15) of
cases were hospitalised for clinical management
and infection control. The remaining cases, in
accordance with infection control procedures,
were assessed to be well enough to self-isolate at
home. One case, previously reported as admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), was actually admitted to a negative pressure isolation
room in an ICU for infection control reasons.

The clinical course of infection was unavailable
from these preliminary data. No deaths were
reported.
A travel history to Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China was reported in 80% of cases (12/15).
The remaining three cases from mainland
China were epidemiologically linked to laboratory-confirmed cases from Wuhan. The five
laboratory-confirmed cases from Queensland
were all part of a tour group of nine people from
mainland China. The index case was isolated on
presentation to hospital and all others within
the tour group were quarantined. Four of those
in quarantine were subsequently confirmed as
cases, one of whom was a co-primary case, who
like the index case had been in Wuhan, Hubei
Province during the 14 days prior to illness
onset. The other three cases were consistent with
secondary transmission from the index case
prior to isolation.

The isolation and quarantine actions undertaken at identification of the index case appear
to have successfully limited further transmission to the isolated tour group. No further cases
were identified amongst close contacts who had
travelled on the same flight, all of whom have
now completed a 14 day quarantine period.

International cases
As at 19:00 AEDT 8 February 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 34,886
globally (Table 2).2 Mainland China reported
99% of cases (34,546) and 721 deaths. Twentyseven countries and Special Administrative
Regions outside of mainland China reported 276
confirmed COVID-19 cases. Two deaths were
reported outside of mainland China, a 44-yearold male Wuhan resident in the Philippines
and a 39-year-old male Hong Kong resident
with recent travel to Wuhan. A cruise ship with
approximately 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined in Japanese territorial waters reported
64 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Background
The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.3
Cases were initially associated with exposure
to a wet market – located in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China – indicating a possible zoonotic
source. Sustained human-to-human transmission is now likely to be occurring in the majority
of provinces outside of Hubei Province in China.
Eleven countries (France, Germany, Japan,
Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Spain,
Thailand, the UK, USA and Vietnam) report
possible or confirmed transmission in close
contact settings outside of China.2,4 There is no
evidence of widespread sustained community
transmission in these countries.
In an effort to contain the spread of the virus,
Chinese authorities imposed a lockdown on the
city of Wuhan on 23 January 2020, suspending all

4 of 12

public transport including international flights.5
The measure was extended to neighbouring
cities in Hubei Province over subsequent days,
quarantining an estimated 50 million people.6
Following advice from the Australian Health
Protection Principle Committee (AHPPC) to
substantially reduce the volume of travellers
coming from mainland China, additional border
measures were implemented in Australia. From
1 February 2020, Australia has denied entry to
anyone who had left or transited through mainland China, with the exception of Australian
citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family and air crew who have been using
appropriate personal protective equipment.7
Australia implemented these measures to slow
the spread of COVID-19 into the country and to
prepare healthcare services and laboratories for
a targeted response.
The current estimates on epidemiological parameters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.

Severity
Patients with COVID-19 infection present with
a wide range of symptoms. Most seem to have
mild disease, and about 18% appear to progress
to severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death.2,8 Fever, dry
non-productive cough and fatigue are common
symptoms.
Reports from China on the clinical presentation
are limited to novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) patients. Of patients with NCIP,
30% develop difficulty breathing five days after
onset of illness (range 1–10 days).9, 10 The median
time from onset of illness to hospitalisation
for NCIP patients was seven days (range 4–8
days), with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) experienced on day eight (range 6–12
days).10 Of 138 NCIP patients, approximately a
quarter required ICU admission (2% receiving
high-flow oxygen, 11% non-invasive ventilation,

9% invasive ventilation and 3% extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)).10 ICU
patients were typically older than 65 years and
had a greater number of comorbidities.
The true fatality rate for COVID-19 cannot be
presently calculated. Diagnosis of COVID-19
will precede death or recovery by days to weeks.
The number of deaths should be compared
to past confirmed cases, taking into account
this lag period and estimating the fraction of
mild under-reported disease.11 Spatio-temporal
variations of the crude fatality rate (deaths/
confirmed cases) are seen in Hubei Province,
2.8% (699/24,953) compared to other provinces
in China, 0.2% (23/9593) and may reflect a focus
in Hubei Province on diagnosing and treating
severe disease and/or a health system struggling
to provide supportive care to a large volume of
patients during the epidemic.

Transmission
The exact nature of transmission is poorly understood. The WHO has reported ‘during previous
outbreaks due to other coronavirus (MiddleEast Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)), humanto-human transmission occurred through
droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that
the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can
be similar’.12 The basic reproductive number,
R0, indicates the contagiousness of an infectious disease and is defined as the average
expected number of secondary cases produced
by a single infection in a completely susceptible
population. Chinese authorities reported a preliminary R0 of 1.4–2.5 on 23 January 2020 to the
WHO International Health Regulations (2005)
Emergency Committee.13 On 31 January 2020,
Thailand reported its first instance of close community human-to-human transmission (not
within a household setting).14
China and France have reported hospital-related
transmission.10,15 In one study from Wuhan, of
138 NCIP patients 41% were presumed infected
in the hospital, including 40 healthcare workers.10 Media have reported shortages of masks

6 of 12

and personal protective equipment in Hubei
Province due to the quarantine measures which
may have exacerbated the high proportion of
hospital-related infections in this study.16 A
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)-confirmed asymptomatic child was
described with radiological signs of pneumonia
reported from a family cluster in Shenzhen,
although onward transmission from this case
was not documented.17 A report describing
a suspected asymptomatic transmission in
Germany was proven inaccurate once health
officials interviewed the patient directly.

Incubation period
Current estimates of the incubation period of
COVID-19 from the WHO range from 2 to 10
days, with these estimates to be refined as more
data become available.12 A recently-published
article characterising the first 425 cases in
Wuhan, Hubei Province China estimated the
mean incubation period to be 5.2 days (95%
confidence interval, 4.1–7.0 days) with the 95th
percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.18 A
modelling paper using known travel history to
and from Wuhan and symptom onset date in 88
exported cases calculated the mean incubation
period to be 6.4 days (95% confidence interval,
5.6–7.7 days) ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th
and 97.5th percentile).19 Both reports support the
use of 14 days as the upper limit of the incubation
period used in the Australian interim advice.20

Recommendations for control
The WHO recommends the general public
reduce their exposure and transmission to
COVID-19 by:
• Frequently cleaning hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water;
• When coughing and sneezing cover mouth
and nose with flexed elbow or tissue –
throw tissue away immediately and wash
hands;
• Avoid close contact with anyone who has

health.gov.au/cdi

fever and cough; and
• If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
breathing seek medical care early and share
previous travel history with your health care
provider.

Treatment
Currently there is no specific medication
recommended for COVID-19. Antibiotics are
not effective against viruses. A number of
antiviral medications will be trialled to assess
whether they can be used to treat COVID-19.
Experimental vaccines are also in development.

Previous case definitions are provided in
Appendix A.
Data for the international cases of COVID-19
by country were compiled from the latest WHO
Situational Report. Case definitions may vary
by country making comparisons difficult. Rapid
reviews of the current state of knowledge on
COVID-19 were conducted from the literature
using PubMed.

Acknowledgements

Clinical care of suspected patients with COVID19 should focus on early recognition, immediate
isolation, implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures and provision of optimised supportive care.8

This report outlines what is known epidemiologically on COVID-19 in Australia and from
publicly available data from WHO Situation
Reports, other countries’ official updates and the
scientific literature. Data on domestic cases in this
report were collected from National Notifiable
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and
state and territory case investigation reports.
The Communicable Diseases Network Australia
(CDNA) developed the case definition for suspected and confirmed cases, which was modified at different time points in the epidemic (23
and 27 January and 2, 4, 6 and 7 February 2020)
(Table 3). CDNA developed national guidance
on investigating suspected and confirmed cases
of COVID-19. Based on this guidance, state and
territory health department investigators conducted interviews of suspected cases to collect
core and enhanced data for inclusion in NNDSS.
Data were analysed using Stata to describe the
epidemiology of infections in Australia and the
progress of the epidemic.

Suspected Cases

Confirmed Cases

As the full clinical spectrum of illness is not
known, clinical and public health judgement
should also be used to determine the need
for testing in patients who do not meet the
clinical criteria below. If the patient satisfies
epidemiological and clinical criteria, they are
classified as a suspect case.

A person who tests positive
to a specific COVID-19 PCR
test (when available) or
has the virus identified by
electron microscopy or
viral culture, at a reference
laboratory.

Epidemiological criteria
• Travel to (including transit through)
mainland China in the 14 days before the
onset of illness.
OR
• Close or casual contact in 14 days before
illness onset with a confirmed case of
COVID-19.
Clinical criteria
• Fever
OR
• Acute respiratory infection (e.g. shortness
of breath or cough) with or without fever
