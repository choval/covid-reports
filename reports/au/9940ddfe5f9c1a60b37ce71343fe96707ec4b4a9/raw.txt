Weekly epidemiological report
2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, Australia
Epidemiology Report 1
Reportingweek26January–1February2020
2019-nCoV National Incident Room Surveillance Team
Summary
This is the first epidemiological report of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) acute respiratory disease
infections reported in Australia at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 1 February 2020.
It includes data on Australian cases notified during the week 26 January to 1 February 2020 and in
the previous week (19 to 25 January 2020), the international situation and current information on the
severity, transmission and spread of the 2019-nCoV infection.
Keywords: novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology;
Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due to
the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every effort has
been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences between
jurisdictions.
In Australia:
• A total of twelve cases of 2019-nCoV
infection were notified up until 1 Febru-
ary 2020;
• All twelve cases reported a travel history
to China, and 92% (11/12) had a travel
history to Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China;
• The majority of cases (92%, 11/12)
developed mild to moderate symptoms,
with one case (8%, 1/12) admitted to
intensive care;
• Zero deaths were reported; and
• Two days elapsed since the onset of ill-
ness in the latest confirmed case and the
date of this report.
Internationally:
• Case numbers are increasing rapidly
with 11,953 infections confirmed glob-
ally; and
• The majority of confirmed infections
(11,821) were reported in China, as well
as 259 deaths.

Domestic cases
There were twelve confirmed cases reported in
Australia as at 19:00 AEDT 1 February 2020
(Table 1). Cases were reported in New South
Wales (n = 4), Victoria (n = 4), Queensland (n
= 2) and South Australia (n = 2). The first onset
of signs and symptoms in a case occurred on 13
January 2020 (Figure 1). The majority of cases
(92%, 11/12) had a travel history to Wuhan.
The remaining case had direct contact with a
confirmed case from Wuhan while travelling
in China. All cases acquired their infection in
China, which resulted in many close contacts
requiring investigation. The median age of cases
was 45 (range 21–66) years. The male-to-female
ratio was 1.4:1. All cases (12/12) reported fever
and/or chills and 83% (10/12) reported cough.
Two cases were reported with pneumonia
(Figure 2). Approximately 75% (9/12) of cases
were hospitalised for clinical management and
infection control, including one patient who was
admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The
clinical course of infection was unavailable from
these preliminary data. There were no deaths
associated with the outbreak in Australia. The
median time between onset of illness and col-
lection of a specimen was 1 day (range 0–9 days).
International status report
As at 19:00 AEST 1 February 2020 the number of
confirmed 2019-nCoV cases was 11,953 globally
(Table 2). Mainland China reported the majority
of cases (11,791) and all of the 259 deaths.1
Background
The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the outbreak of 2019-nCoV a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.2
Cases were ini-
tially associated with exposure to a wet market
– located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China –
indicating a possible zoonotic source. Sustained
human-to-human transmission is now likely to
be occurring in the majority of provinces out-
side of Hubei Province in China. Additionally,
limited instances of human-to-human trans-
mission were observed in a number of countries
outside mainland China.3, 4
As of 1 February 2020, mainland China had
reported 11,791 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases and
259 deaths.5
As of 1 February 2020, countries and Special
Administrative Regions outside of mainland
China reported 162 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases
and zero deaths.
The current estimates on epidemiological param-
eters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.
Severity
Patients with 2019-nCoV infection present with
a wide range of symptoms. Most seem to have

mild disease, and about 20% appear to progress
to severe disease, including pneumonia, respira-
tory failure and in some cases death.6
Transmission
The exact nature of transmission is poorly
understood. WHO report ‘during previous
outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)), human-to-
human transmission occurred through droplets,
contact and fomites, suggesting that the trans-
mission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar’.7
Sustained human-to-human transmission is
likely to be now occurring in the majority of
provinces in mainland China. The basic repro-
ductive number, R0
, indicates how contagious an
infectious disease is and is defined as the average
expected number of secondary cases produced
by a single infection in a completely susceptible
population. Chinese authorities reported a pre-
liminary R0
of 1.4–2.5 on 23 January 2020 to the
WHO International Health Regulations (2005)
Emergency Committee.8
On 31 January 2020,
Thailand reported its first instance of close com-
munity human-to-human transmission (not
within a household setting).9
Other instances
were reported in Japan, Germany and Vietnam.4
Incubation period
Current estimates of the incubation period of
2019-nCoV from the WHO range from 2 to 10
days, with these estimates to be refined as more
data become available.7
A recently-published
article characterising the first 425 cases in
Wuhan, Hubei Province China estimated the
mean incubation period to be 5.2 days (95%
confidence interval, 4.1–7.0).10
Recommendations for control
The WHO recommends the general public
reduce their exposure and transmission to 2019-
nCoV by:
• Frequently cleaning hands by using alcohol-
based hand rub or soap and water;
• When coughing and sneezing cover mouth
and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw
tissue away immediately and wash hands;
• Avoid close contact with anyone who has
fever and cough;
• If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
breathing seek medical care early and share
previous travel history with your health care
provider.
Treatment
Currently there is no specific medication rec-
ommended for 2019-nCoV. Antibiotics are not
effective against viruses. Some antiviral medi-
cations have shown promise in treating MERS
and are now being tested for their effectiveness
against 2019-nCoV.11
Experimental vaccines are
also in development. Clinical care of suspected
patients with 2019-nCoV should focus on early
recognition, immediate isolation, implementa-
tion of appropriate infection prevention and
control measures and provision of optimised
supportive care.6
Methods
Data for this report were current as at 19:00
hours AEDT, 1 February 2020.
This report outlines what is known epidemio-
logically on 2019-nCoV in Australia and from
publicly available data from WHO Situation
Reports, other countries’ official updates and
the scientific literature. Data on domestic cases
in this report were collected from National
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
(NNDSS) and state and territory case investi-
gation reports. The Communicable Diseases
Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case
definition for suspected and confirmed cases,
which was modified at different time points in
the epidemic (23 January and 27 January 2020)
(Table 3). CDNA developed national guidance
on investigating suspected and confirmed cases
of 2019-nCoV. Based on this guidance, state and
territory health department investigators con-

CommunDisIntell(2018) 2020;44(https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.13) Epub 6/2/2020
ducted interviews of suspected cases to collect
core and enhanced data for inclusion in NNDSS.
Data were analysed using Stata to describe the
epidemiology of infections in Australia and the
progress of the epidemic.
Data for the international reports of 2019-nCoV
case numbers by country were compiled from a
range of sources. Case definitions for these case
counts varied considerably making comparisons
difficult. Rapid reviews of the current state of
knowledge on 2019-nCoV were conducted from
the literature using PubMed.

27 January 2020 As the full clinical spectrum of illness is not known, clinical and
public health judgement should also be used to determine the
need for testing in patients who do not meet the clinical criteria
below. If the patient satisfies epidemiological and clinical criteria,
they are classified as a suspect case.
Epidemiological criteria
• Travel to Hubei Province, China in the 14 days before the
onset of illness.a
OR
• Travel to agreed areas of human-to-human transmission, or a
declared outbreak, within 14 days before onset of illness.
OR
• Close contact in 14 days before illness onset with a case of
2019-nCoV.
Clinical criteria
• Fever or history of fever (≥38 °C) and acute respiratory
infection (sudden onset of respiratory infection with at least
one of: shortness of breath, cough or sore throat).
OR
• Severe acute respiratory infection requiring admission to
hospital with clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia
or acute respiratory distress syndrome (i.e. even if no
evidence of fever).
A person who
tests positive to a
specific 2019-nCoV
PCR test (when
available) or has
the virus identified
by electron
microscopy or
viral culture,
at a reference
laboratory.
a
The previous case definition developed on 23 January 2020 required that suspected cases had travelled to the city of Wuhan.
