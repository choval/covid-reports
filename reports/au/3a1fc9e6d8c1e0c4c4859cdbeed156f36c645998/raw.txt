Weekly epidemiological report

COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 3:
Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team

Summary
This is the third epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), previously known as
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), from the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2, reported in Australia as
at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 15 February 2020. It includes data on the COVID19 Australian cases, the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission
and spread.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; acute
respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology; Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due to
the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every effort
has been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences
between jurisdictions.
In Australia:

Internationally:

• A total of fifteen COVID-19 cases were
notified up until 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020;

• Case numbers are increasing rapidly
with 67,102 infections confirmed globally;

• All fifteen cases reported a travel history
to China;

• The majority of confirmed infections
(66,492) were reported in mainland
China, as well as 1,523 deaths;

• Zero deaths were reported;
• At the conclusion of this report’s coverage, eleven days have elapsed since the
onset of illness in the latest confirmed
case; and
• On 13 February 2020, the Australian
Health Protection Principal Committee
(AHPPC) issued a statement on resolution on travel restrictions and COVID-9
recommending that the current travel
restrictions remain in place.

health.gov.au/cdi

• On 12 February 2020 the case diagnosis
classification in Hubei Province was
changed to include clinically diagnosed
cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases.
• As of 15 February 2020, Hubei Province
reported 54,406 cases, of which 30%
(16,522) were clinically diagnosed; and
• Three deaths were reported outside
mainland China, one each in Hong
Kong, Japan and the Philippines.

Domestic cases
There were fifteen confirmed cases reported
in Australia at 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020
(Table 1). Cases were reported in New South
Wales (n = 4), Victoria (n = 4), Queensland (n
= 5) and South Australia (n = 2). The first onset
of signs and symptoms in a case occurred on 13
January 2020 (Figure 1). The median age of cases
was 43 (range 8–66) years. The male-to-female
ratio was 1.5:1. Fourteen of the 15 cases (93%)
reported fever and/or chills and 73% (11/15)
reported cough. Two cases reported with pneumonia. Approximately 73% (11/15) of cases were
hospitalised for clinical management and infection control. The remaining cases, in accordance
with infection control procedures, were assessed
to be well enough to self-isolate at home. The
clinical course of infection was unavailable
from these preliminary data. No deaths were
reported.
The five laboratory-confirmed cases from
Queensland were all part of a tour group of nine
people from mainland China. The index case
was isolated on presentation to hospital and all
others within the tour group were quarantined.
Four of those in quarantine were subsequently
confirmed as cases, one of whom was a coprimary case, who like the index case had been
in Wuhan, Hubei Province during the 14 days
prior to illness onset. The other three cases were
consistent with secondary transmission from
the index case prior to isolation.

International cases
On 12 February 2020 the General Office of the
National Health Commission of the People’s
Republic of China and the Office of the
State Administration of Traditional Chinese
Medicine added clinical diagnosis to the case
diagnosis classification in Hubei Province.
This change was issued through the ‘Diagnosis
and Treatment Plan for Pneumonia of New
Coronavirus (Version)’ to ensure that patients
can receive standardised treatment according to
confirmed cases as early as possible to further
improve the success rate of treatment.2 This is

2 of 14

the first time China has reported clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed
cases.3 The number of clinically-diagnosed cases
in Hubei Province will be included in the number of confirmed cases for publication from 12
February 2020 onwards.2
As at 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 67,102
globally, including 16,522 clinically-diagnosed
cases from Hubei Province, China (Table 2).4
Mainland China reported 99% of cases (66,492)
and 1,523 deaths. Twenty-eight countries
and Special Administrative Regions outside
of mainland China reported 392 confirmed
COVID-19 cases. Three deaths were reported
outside of mainland China, a 44-year-old male
Wuhan resident in the Philippines, a 39-year-old
male Hong Kong resident with recent travel to
Wuhan and a female in her 80s from Kanagawa
Prefecture near Tokyo, Japan who had no recent
travel history to China. A cruise ship with
approximately 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined in Japanese territorial waters reported
218 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Background
The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.5
Cases were initially associated with exposure to a
wet market – located in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China – indicating a possible zoonotic source.
Sustained human-to-human transmission is
now occurring in the majority of provinces
outside of Hubei Province in China. Fourteen
countries (Australia, Egypt, France, Germany,
Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore,
Spain, Thailand, UAE, UK, USA and Vietnam)
report possible or confirmed transmission in
close contact settings outside of China.4,6,7 There
is no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission in these countries.

Jurisdiction

In an effort to contain the spread of the virus,
Chinese authorities imposed a lockdown on the
city of Wuhan on 23 January 2020, suspending all
public transport including international flights.8
The measure was extended to neighbouring
cities in Hubei Province over subsequent days,
quarantining an estimated 50 million people.9

manageable program of self-isolation of recent
arrivals. Border measures to screen flights and
vessels from mainland China and for people
who have come from or transited through mainland China in the past 14 days should continue
as should the policy of requiring isolation for 14
days after leaving mainland China.11

Following advice from the Australian Health
Protection Principle Committee (AHPPC) to
substantially reduce the volume of travellers
coming from mainland China, additional border
measures were implemented in Australia. From
1 February 2020, Australia has denied entry to
anyone who had left or transited through mainland China, with the exception of Australian
citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family and air crew who have been using
appropriate personal protective equipment.10
Australia implemented these measures to slow
the spread of COVID-19 into the country and to
prepare healthcare services and laboratories for
a targeted response.

The WHO continues to reiterate its concern for
high-risk nations with weaker health systems
that may lack the facilities to identify and manage COVID-19 cases.12

On 13 February 2020, AHPPC released a statement on the resolution on travel restrictions
and coronavirus (COVID-19) recommending
current travel restrictions remain in place.11
AHPPC noted approximately 70% reduction in
entry to Australia of people who have been in
mainland China, contributing to a much more

The current estimates on epidemiological parameters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.

Severity
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Patients present with a wide range of symptoms. Most seem
to have mild disease, and about 18% appear to
progress to severe disease, including pneumonia,
respiratory failure and in some cases death.13
Fever, dry non-productive cough and fatigue are
common symptoms. Atypical features include
dizziness, headache, vomiting and abdominal
pain.14

Date of illness onset

a

Date of illness onset for New South Wales, Queensland and Victorian cases has been corrected since Epidemiology Report 2.1

Reports from China on the clinical presentation
are limited to novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) patients. Of patients with NCIP,
30% develop difficulty breathing five days after
onset of illness (range 1–10 days).14,15 The median
time from onset of illness to hospitalisation
for NCIP patients was seven days (range 4–8
days), with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) experienced on day eight (range 6–12
days).14 Of 138 NCIP patients, approximately a
quarter required ICU admission (2% receiving
high-flow oxygen, 11% non-invasive ventilation,
9% invasive ventilation and 3% extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)).14 ICU
patients were typically older than 65 years and
had a greater number of comorbidities. The first
case report from the US described the clinical
course and management of a case, including the
patient’s initial mild symptoms that progressed
to pneumonia on day 9 of illness.6 These studies
suggests clinicians should be prepared for some

health.gov.au/cdi

individuals, who initially present with mild-tomoderate symptoms, to deteriorate over subsequent days to severe disease.
Evidence on COVID-19 in pregnant women and
children is limited. Concern was raised when a
baby 30 hours after birth was confirmed with
COVID-19; however, close contact history cannot be excluded.16,17 In a small study evaluating
the clinical characteristics of nine pregnant
women with confirmed COVID-19, no evidence
of transplacental or perinatal viral transmission
was detected.15 No women developed pneumonia or died. Delivery of nine live births by caesarean was employed to reduce risk of vertical
transmission or due to pre-existing conditions.
It is premature to consider a caesarean delivery
a universal prevention approach.18 Larger studies with longer duration are needed to confirm
these results. According to a recent review,
children (ranging from 1 month to 17 years)
made up 0.3% (28/9682) of all confirmed cases
in Wuhan City by 30 January 2020.19

Cases presented with mild clinical manifestations with some asymptomatic infections.19 No
deaths were reported.

comparable, while mathematical methods produced estimates on the higher side. R0 in more
recent studies has stabilised around 2–3.

The true fatality rate for COVID-19 cannot be
presently calculated. Diagnosis of COVID-19
will precede death or recovery by days to weeks.
The number of deaths should be compared
to past confirmed cases, taking into account
this lag period and estimating the fraction of
mild under-reported disease.20 In a pre-print,
non-peer-reviewed study of 4,021 cases with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 where approximately 48% were aged over 50 years, the case
fatality rate (CFR) was 3.06%.21 When stratified
by sex and age, male patients had a CFR of 4.45
compared to 1.25 in females, and those ≥ 60
years had a CFR of 5.30 versus those < 60 years
of 1.43. This emphasises the importance of early
detection in elderly patients, particularly males,
to pre-empt clinical deterioration.

China and France have reported hospital-related
transmission.14,25 In one study from Wuhan, of
138 NCIP patients 41% were presumed infected
in the hospital, including 40 healthcare workers.14 Media have reported shortages of masks
and personal protective equipment in Hubei
Province due to the quarantine measures which
may have exacerbated the high proportion of
hospital-related infections in this study.26 On
14 February China confirmed 1,716 medical
staff infected, 87.5% (1502/1716) from Hubei
Province, and six deaths.27

Transmission
The exact nature of transmission is poorly understood. The WHO has reported ‘during previous
outbreaks due to other coronavirus (MiddleEast Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)), humanto-human transmission occurred through
droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that
the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can
be similar’.22 The basic reproductive number,
R0, indicates the contagiousness of an infectious disease and is defined as the average
expected number of secondary cases produced
by a single infection in a completely susceptible
population. Chinese authorities reported a preliminary R0 of 1.4–2.5 on 23 January 2020 to the
WHO International Health Regulations (2005)
Emergency Committee.23 On 13 February a
review of 12 studies which estimated the R0
was published. It found the mean R0 to be 3.28
and median R0 to be 2.79, which exceeds the
WHO preliminary R0 of 1.4–2.5 (average 1.95).24
Models using stochastic and statistical methods,
such as exponential growth were reasonably

6 of 14

Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infection
has been reported.4,28 A reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed
asymptomatic child was described with radiological signs of pneumonia reported from a
family cluster in Shenzhen, although onward
transmission from this case was not documented.29 On 15 February Egypt confirmed an
asymptomatic COVID-19 case. The case was
identified through contact screening of an index
case who travelled from China to Egypt.30 A
report describing a suspected asymptomatic
transmission in Germany was proven inaccurate once health officials interviewed the patient
directly.31

Incubation period
Current estimates of the incubation period of
COVID-19 from the WHO range from 2 to 10
days, with these estimates to be refined as more
data become available.22 A recently-published
article characterising the first 425 cases in
Wuhan, Hubei Province China estimated the
mean incubation period to be 5.2 days (95%
confidence interval, 4.1–7.0 days) with the 95th
percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.32 A
modelling paper using known travel history to
and from Wuhan and symptom onset date in 88
exported cases calculated the mean incubation
period to be 6.4 days (95% confidence interval,
5.6–7.7 days) ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th

health.gov.au/cdi

and 97.5th percentile).33 Both reports support the
use of 14 days as the upper limit of the incubation
period used in the Australian interim advice.34
Using 50 patients with well-defined exposure
periods Jiang et al. applied various statistical
models to the dataset and inferred the mean
incubation period was 4.9 days (95% confidence
interval, 4.4–5.5 days).35

Treatment

A pre-print non-peer-reviewed article posted on
9 February retrospectively described the clinical
characteristics of 1,099 patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 acute respiratory disease
(ARD) from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in
China. The results suggested that the median
incubation period was 3 days, ranging from
0 to 24 days.36 The researchers relied on clinical records and did not conduct active contact
tracing. This study was refuted by two Canadian
medical experts who described the reports of
patients with 24-day incubation periods as ‘outliers’ that should be studied further and do not
represent a significant shift in thinking around
the virus.37

Clinical care of suspected patients with COVID19 should focus on early recognition, immediate
isolation, implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures and provision of optimised supportive care.8

Recommendations for control
The WHO recommends the general public
reduce their exposure and transmission to
COVID-19 by:
• Frequently cleaning hands by using alcoholbased hand rub or soap and water;
• When coughing and sneezing cover mouth
and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw
tissue away immediately and wash hands;
• Avoid close contact with anyone who has
fever and cough; and
• If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
breathing seek medical care early and share
previous travel history with your health care
provider.

Currently there is no specific medication
recommended for COVID-19. Antibiotics are
not effective against viruses. A number of
antiviral medications will be trialled to assess
whether they can be used to treat COVID-19.
Experimental vaccines are also in development.

Virology
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,
is 96% identical to the whole genome sequence
of a known bat coronavirus (BATCoV RaTG13)
and 79.5% identical to SARS-CoV-1.38 Like
SARS-CoV-1, it attaches its spike (S) protein to
the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)
to enter and infect host cells located in the lower
respiratory tract.38 Progressive respiratory failure is due to alveolar damage.38

Methods
Data for this report were current as at 19:00
hours AEDT, 15 February 2020.
This report outlines what is known epidemiologically on COVID-19 in Australia and from
publicly available data from WHO Situation
Reports, other countries’ official updates and the
scientific literature. Data on domestic cases in this
report were collected from National Notifiable
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and
state and territory case investigation reports.
The Communicable Diseases Network Australia
(CDNA) developed the case definition for suspected and confirmed cases, which was modified
at different time points in the epidemic (23 and
27 January and 2, 4, 6, 7 and 14 February 2020)
(Table 3). CDNA developed national guidance
on investigating suspected and confirmed cases
of COVID-19. Based on this guidance, state and
territory health department investigators con-
