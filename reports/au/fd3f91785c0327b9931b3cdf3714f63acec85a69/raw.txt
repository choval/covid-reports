COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team
Notified cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths reported to the National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System (NNDSS) to 5 April 2020.
Summary
Notifications in Australia remain predomi-
nantly among people with recent overseas travel,
with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked
back to a confirmed case, with a small portion
unable to be epidemiologically linked. The dis-
tribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally
acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
Early indications are that reduction in interna-
tional travel, domestic movement, social dis-
tancing measures and public health action are
slowing the spread of the disease (Figure 1).
Internationally, cases continue to increase, with
high rates of increase observed in the European
Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to
5 April 2020i

Deaths 33
region and the United States of America. The
epidemiology differs from country to country
depending not only on the disease, but also on
differences in case detection, testing and imple-
mented public health measures.

Australian cases: descriptive
epidemiology
National trends
• Over the past week, 1,646 cases of
COVID-19 were notified to the NNDSS,
bringing the total number of confirmed cases
notified in Australia to 5,805 (up to 23:59
AEST 5 April 2020). This is a 30% decrease in
weekly new cases compared to the previous
reporting period (n = 2,355);
• Forty-one cases (0.8%) have been reported in
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons
since the start of the outbreak. These cases
were reported across several jurisdictions,
with the majority reported in areas classi-
fied as ‘major cities of Australia’ based on
the case’s usual place of residence. Across all
Australian cases, completeness of the Indig-
enous status field was approximately 79%,
with 21% of cases with a reported value of
‘unknown’; and
• The median time between onset of symptoms
and laboratory testing was 3 days (range
0–42 days).
Geographical Distribution
• Cases of COVID-19 continue to be reported
at varying rates in all jurisdictions (Table 1);
• New South Wales had the highest rate of
COVID-19 notifications (32.9 per 100,000)
and the Northern Territory had the lowest
(11.0 per 100,000); and
• Most cases were reported to reside in major
metropolitan areas, with a small number of
cases residing outside these areas (Figure 2
and Figure 3).

Age and gender distribution
• Cases of COVID-19 were reported across all
age groups. The median age of all COVID-19
cases was 47 years (range: 0 to 100 years);
• The number of cases was highest in the
20–29 years age group, and the highest rate
of disease was among those in the 60–69
years age group (Figure 4); and
• Notifications by gender were approximately
equal, although there was some variation
across age groups.
Source of infection
• To date, most of the reported COVID-19
cases in Australia acquired their infection
overseas;
• Of cases with a reported place of acquisition,
66% had a recent international travel history
and 32% were considered to have been lo-
cally acquired (Figure 5):
◦
◦ The majority of overseas-acquired cases
reported a travel history to the Euro-
pean Region, the Americas Region or on
board cruise ships (Figure 6);
◦
◦ Of the locally-acquired cases, most were
considered to be contacts of a confirmed
case, with a very small proportion of
cases not able to be epidemiologically
linked to a confirmed case; and
◦
◦ Cases where a place of acquisition has
not been reported (2%) are currently
under public health investigation.
Cluster and outbreak investigations
Investigations are taking place in states and ter-
ritories in relation to a number of clusters and
outbreaks of COVID-19. To date the largest out-
breaks have been associated with cruise ships.
Cruise ships account for a substantial propor-
tion of cases of COVID-19 in Australia. Of cases
with a reported place of acquisition, 16% (n =
903) were acquired at sea on a cruise ship. This
is a 35% increase in COVID-19 cases acquired
on a cruise ship since the last reporting period.
There have been 14 deaths among cases acquired
on cruise ships in Australia.
Cluster:
• The term ‘cluster’ in relation to COV-
ID-19 refers to two or more cases that
are epidemiologically related in time,
place or person where a common source
(such as an event or within a commu-
nity) of infection is suspected but not
yet established.
Outbreak:
• The term ‘outbreak’ in relation to
COVID-19 refers to two or more cases
among a specific group of people and/
or over a specific period of time where
illness is associated with a common
source (such as an event or within a
community).

Symptom profile
• Of the symptoms reported, cough (71%) was
the most common (Figure 7);
• Forty-nine percent reported fever, 44%
reported sore throat, and 39% reported
headache. Only 4% or fewer of all cases re-
ported either pneumonia or acute respiratory
disease (ARD); and
• In addition, loss of taste was reported from
324 cases and loss of smell from 322 cases.
These conditions were reported in at least
5.5% of cases, noting that this is currently not
a standard field in NNDSS, and is likely to
under-represent those presenting with these
symptoms.
Severity
• Of the total cases of COVID-19 (n = 5,805)
notified, 11% (n = 628) were admitted to
hospital:
◦
◦ The median age of hospitalised cases
was 59.5 years (range 0–94 years), with
the highest proportion of hospitalised
cases in the 60–69 years age group:
◦
◦ The most commonly reported comor-
bid condition among hospitalised cases
was cardiac disease (7.5%), followed by
diabetes (7.2%);
• Of the hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 13% (n
= 82) were admitted to an intensive care unit
(ICU), with 29 cases requiring ventilation;
• Thirty-three COVID-19 associated deaths
were confirmed in Australia up to 5 April
2020:
◦
◦ The median age of cases who died was
80 years (range 60–94 years);
◦
◦ 21 of the cases were male and 12 were
female; and
◦
◦ The most commonly reported comorbid
conditions among COVID-19 deaths
were chronic respiratory conditions
(15%) and diabetes (15%).
Additional surveillance activities
Enhanced surveillance within schools and
child care settings
The National Centre for Immunisation Research
andSurveillance(NCIRS)andtheNSWMinistry
of Health have commenced an investigation into
the transmission of SARS COV-2 in school and
child-care centre settings. Preliminary find-
ings suggest low onward transmission among
children with 1.9% of close contacts who were
children testing positive for the virus.
This investigation includes follow up of labora-
tory notifications and in some settings enhanced
clinical investigation including additional ques-
tionnaire, active nasopharyngeal sampling and
serology testing of close contacts via school/
home visiting teams.

CommunDisIntell(2018) 2020;44 (https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.30) Epub 9/4/2020
Preliminary activities and findings to date:
• Twenty-one educational settings with
COVID cases have been identified to date:
eleven secondary schools, two primary
schools, and eight childcare centres;
• Index cases have been adult staff in ten sites
and children in eleven sites;
• Total close contacts identified were: 903 chil-
dren and 179 staff from 17 sites (contact lists
are pending for 4 sites);
• Enhanced investigations is underway in five
sites, with three additional sites in planning
stage; and
• Of the 16 sites where nasopharyngeal sam-
pling nucleic acid testing data is available for
close contacts:
◦
◦ 7/361 children tested and 7/84 adults
tested have been positive for SARS-
CoV-2 within the 14 days after last
known exposure.
Results of serologic testing (in symptomatic and
asymptomatic contacts) is pending for some
sites and will be reported when available.
Results presented are preliminary and are sub-
ject to change as the study progress, and as such
should be interpreted with caution.
Public health response
Since COVID-19 first emerged internationally,
Australia has implemented public health meas-
ures in response to the disease’s epidemiology,
both overseas and in Australia. During the
current reporting period, the Australian Health
Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) has
issuedadvicetoinformthenationalpublichealth
response to the pandemic including manage-
ment of Early Childhood and Learning Centres
(ECLC) in relation to community transmission
of COVID-19, special provisions to vulnerable
people in the workplace, and regional additional
social distancing measures. As part of the com-
prehensive public health response taking place
across Australia, social distancing plays a vital
role in reducing transmission and flattening the
curve. Additional public health responses are
listed below in Table 2.

International situation3
• As at 23:59 AEST 5 April 2020, the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) was
1,133,758 globally;
• The number of new cases reported glob-
ally has continued to increase. As of the last
reporting week, with COVID-19 reported
across a total of 199 countries, territories and
areas;
• The reported epidemiology varies by country
with different trajectories of outbreaks after
their first 100 cases. Figure 8 highlights that
for a number of countries outside of main-
land China which have reported more than
100 cases, their rates of increase continue to
be high, particularly USA, Spain and Italy.
For several other countries or regions includ-
ing Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, there
continues to be a slow rate of increase in
their number of new cases, with the Republic
of Korea reporting very few new cases each
day. Reported case numbers will be influ-
enced by rates of testing, case definition, and
case detection as well as overall health system
capacity;
• Globally, 62,784 deaths have been reported.
The risk of death is reported to increase with
age; and
• The case fatality rate is reported as ap-
proximately 6%. This is highly likely to be an
overestimate due to variable levels of under-
ascertainment of cases, especially those with
mild infections. For several other countries
or regions including Japan and Republic of
Korea, there continues to be a slow increase
in their number of deaths, with both coun-
tries reporting few new deaths each day
(Figure 9).
Background
The current estimates on epidemiological param-
eters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.
Transmission
• Human-to-human transmission of SARS-
CoV-2 is via droplets and fomites from an
infected person to a close contact;4
• A virological analysis of nine hospitalised
cases found active virus replication in up-
per respiratory tract tissues, with pharyn-
geal virus shedding during the first week of
symptoms. However, current evidence does
not support airborne or faecal-oral spread as
major factors in transmission;
• A study in China showed an association
between household contacts and travel with a
confirmed COVID-19 case and an increased
risk of infection;5
and
• A recent study suggests that children do not
play a key role in household transmission
and are unlikely to be the primary source of
household infections.6
Incubation period
• Estimates of median incubation period,
based on seven published studies, are 5 to
6 days (ranging from 0 to 14 days). Patients
with long incubation periods do occasionally
occur, however they are likely to be ‘outliers’
who should be studied further but are un-
likely to represent a change in epidemiology
of the virus.7,8

Molecular epidemiology
• Since December 2019, the virus has diversi-
fied into multiple lineages as it has spread
globally with some degree of geographical
clustering;
• The whole genome sequences currently
available from Australian cases are mostly in
returned travellers from China, the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Europe and the USA, and
thereby reflect this global diversity; and
• Recent work describes an emerging clade
linked to the epidemic in the Islamic Repub-
lic of Iran.9
Clinical features
• COVID-19 presents as mild illness in the
majority of cases with cough and fever being
the most commonly reported symptoms.
Severe or fatal outcomes are more likely to
occur in the elderly or those with comorbid
conditions;4,10
• Some COVID-19 patients show neurological
signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting.
There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 viruses
are not always confined to the respiratory
tract and may invade the central nervous
system inducing neurological symptoms. As
such, it is possible that invasion of the central
nervous system is partially responsible for
the acute respiratory failure of COVID-19
patients;11
• There is some evidence to suggest that reduc-
tion or loss of the sense of smell (hyposmia/
anosmia) or taste (hypoguesia/aguesia) is
associated with COVID-19.12,13
This is sup-
ported by research finding a biological
mechanism for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to
cause olfactory dysfunction;14,15
• Examination of cases and their close con-
tacts in China found a positive association
between age and time from symptom onset
to recovery. The study also found an associa-
tion between clinical severity and time from
symptom onset to time to recovery. Com-
pared to people with mild disease, those with
moderate and severe disease were associ-
ated with a 19% and 58% increase in time to
recovery, respectively;5
and
• Several studies have identified cardiovascu-
lar implications resulting from COVID-19
infection. Vascular inflammation has been
observed in a number of cases and may be a
potential mechanism for myocardial injury
which can result in cardiac dysfunction and
arrhythmias.
Treatment
• Current clinical management of COVID-19
cases focuses on early recognition, isolation,
appropriate infection control measures and
provision of supportive care.16
Whilst there
is no specific antiviral treatment currently
recommended for patients with suspected
or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, mul-
tiple clinical trials are underway to evaluate
a number of therapeutic agents, including
remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and chloro-
quine.17
Data considerations
Data were extracted from the NNDSS on 7 April
2020, by diagnosis date. Due to the dynamic
nature of the NNDSS, data in this extract are
subject to retrospective revision and may vary
from data reported in published NNDSS reports
and reports of notification data by states and
territories.

Appendix A: Frequently asked
questions
Q: Can I request access to the COVID-19 data
behind your CDI weekly reports?
A: National notification data on COVID-19
confirmed cases is collated in the National
Notifiable Disease Surveillance System
(NNDSS) based on notifications made to
state and territory health authorities under
the provisions of their relevant public health
legislation.
Normally, requests for the release of data from
the NNDSS requires agreement from states
and territories via the Communicable Diseases
Network Australia, and, depending on the
sensitivity of the data sought and proposed,
ethics approval may also be required.
Due to the COVID-19 response, unfortunately,
specific requests for NNDSS data have been put
on hold. We are currently looking into options
to be able to respond to data requests in the
near future.
We will continue to publish regular summaries
and analyses of the NNDSS dataset and recom-
mend the following resources be referred to in
the meantime:
• NNDSS summary tables: http://www9.
health.gov.au/cda/source/cda-index.cfm
• Daily case summary of cases: https://www.
health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-
coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/corona-
virus-covid-19-current-situation-and-case-
numbers
• Communicable Diseases Intelligence COV-
ID-19 weekly epidemiology report: https://
www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publish-
ing.nsf/Content/novel_coronavirus_2019_
ncov_weekly_epidemiology_reports_aus-
tralia_2020.htm
• State and territory public health websites.
Q: Can I request access to data at post-code
level of confirmed cases?
A: Data at this level cannot be released without
ethics approval and permission would need to
be sought from all states and territories via the
Communicable Diseases Network Australia. As
noted above, specific requests for NNDSS data
are currently on hold.
A GIS/mapping analysis of cases will be
included in each Communicable Diseases
Intelligence COVID-19 weekly epidemiology
report. In order to protect privacy of confirmed
cases, data in this map will be presented at SA3
level.
Q. Where can I find more detailed data on
COVID-19 cases?
A: We are currently looking into ways to pro-
vide more in-depth epidemiological analyses of
COVID-19 cases, with regard to transmission
and severity, including hospitalisation. These
analyses will continue to be built upon in
future iterations of the weekly Communicable
Diseases Intelligence report.
