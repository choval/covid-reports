Weekly epidemiological report
COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 8:
Reportingperiodfrom19:00AEDT14Marchto23:59AEDT22March2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team
Summary
This is the eighth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in
Australia as at 23:59 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 22 March 2020. It includes data on
COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; acute
respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology; Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due
to the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every
effort has been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences
between jurisdictions.
Australian situation
As at 23:59 AEDT 22 March 2020, there were
1,765 confirmed cases, including seven deaths,
in Australia, reported to the National Notifiable
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)i
(Table
1, Figure 1). Of the 1,765 confirmed cases, 43%
(n = 766) were reported in NSW, 21% (n = 362)
from Qld, 18% (n = 313) from Vic, 8% (n = 137)
from SA, 7% (n = 130) from WA, 2% (n = 32)
from ACT, 1% (n = 21) from Tas, and 0.2% (n
= 4) from NT (Figure 2). The rate of cases in
Australia per 100,000 population was 7.0; this
varied across jurisdictions with NSW 9.5, SA
7.8, ACT 7.5, Qld 7.1, WA 5.0, Vic 4.8, Tas 3.9
and NT 1.6. Of the cases with a usual residence
in Australia, most cases are reported to reside
i Data were extracted on 24 March 2020 with data reported
to 22 March 2020. Due to the dynamic nature of the NNDSS,
data in this extract are subject to retrospective revision and
may vary from data published in previous reports and reports
of notification data by states and territories.
within major metropolitan areas, with a small
number of cases reported outside these areas
(Figure 2).
During the current reporting period a total of
1,143 cases were reported. NSW (38%) reported
the largest number of new cases, followed by
Queensland (24%).
The median age of all 1,795 reported Australian
cases was 48 years (range 0–94 years), with the
highest proportion of cases aged between 20–29
and 60–69 years (Figure 3). Confirmed case rates
within a given age cohort were highest for both
males and females aged 60–69 years (Figure 4).
There continue to be very few cases reported
among children. The male-to-female ratio was
approximately 1:1 overall.
Of the 1,765 confirmed cases, 51% (n = 907) had
data on symptoms. Of the symptoms reported,
cough (69%; n=628) was the most common.
Fifty percent (n = 454) reported fever, 46%
(n = 415) reported sore throat, 36% (n = 329)
reported headache, and 28% (n = 251) reported
muscular pain. Only 2% or fewer of all cases

In Australia:
• There have been 1,765 confirmed cases, including seven deaths, reported in Australia as at
23:59 AEDT 22 March 2020. Of confirmed cases, 43% were reported from NSW, 21% from
Qld, 18% from Vic, 8% from SA, 7% from WA, 2% from ACT, 1% from Tas, and 0.2% from
NT;
• Sixty-five percent of the total number of reported cases so far have been during the current
reporting period;
• Hospitalisation status was recorded for 717 cases, of which 26% (n = 190) were reported to
have been hospitalised due to their COVID-19 infection. Of these hospitalised cases, ICU
(Intensive Care Unit) status was recorded for 87 cases, of which 20% (n = 17) were were ad-
mitted to an ICU, with two cases requiring ventilation; and
• Virus genome sequences currently available from Australian cases indicate introductions
from China, Iran, Europe and the USA, reflecting global diversity of SARS-COV-2 and cor-
roborating field epidemiology.
Internationally:
• 292,142 infections have been confirmed globally, with 12,784 deaths;
• Cases have so far been reported in 175 countries, territories and areas globally;
• So far, the largest number of confirmed infections (29%; n = 81,498) within any country has
been reported in mainland China, with the largest number of deaths (38%; n = 4,827) in
Italy;
• The number of daily new cases reported in mainland China has continued to decrease. Cases
have continued to increase in other countries, territories and areas globally, with the greatest
increases currently occurring in the European Region; and
• Approximately 52% (n = 151,293) of all cases have been reported from the European Region,
predominately from Italy, Spain, Germany and France.

reported either abdominal pain, pneumonia or
acute respiratory disease (ARD). An analysis of
symptom combinations highlights that cough is
the predominant clinical presentation in combi-
nation with fever and/or sore throat (Figure 5).
Hospitalisation status was recorded for 717 cases
of which 26% (n = 190) were reported to have
been hospitalised due to their COVID-19 infec-
tion. Of these hospitalised cases, ICU (Intensive
Care Unit) status was recorded for 87 cases of
which 20% (n = 17) were recorded being admit-
ted to an ICU, with two cases requiring ventila-
tion.
Seven COVID-19 deaths were confirmed in
Australia up to 22 March 2020. The median age
of deceased individuals was 81 years (range 78
to 94 years). Three of these deaths were from
an aged care facility, one was associated with
a cruise ship repatriation and the other three
cases were acquired in the community. Three of
the cases were male and four were female. The
period between the date of illness onset and
death ranged from 0 to 12 days.
Of cases with a reported place of acquisition
(1,281 of 1,765), sixty-eight percent (n = 872)
had a recent international travel history and
32% (n = 409) were locally acquired (Figure 6).
The majority of recent overseas acquired cases
reported a travel history to the European Region
or the Americas Region. Of the locally acquired
cases the majority were considered to be con-
tacts of a confirmed case, with a very small
number of cases not able to be epidemiologically
linked to a confirmed case. For the remainder of
cases where a place of acquisition has not been
reported, these cases are currently under public
health investigation.
Virus genome sequences currently available
from Australian cases indicate introductions
from China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Europe
and the USA, reflecting the global diversity of
SARS-COV-2 and corroborating field epidemi-
ology (Figure 7).
International situation
As at 23:59 AEDT 22 March 2020, the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) was
292,142 globally.1
The proportion of total cases
reported from mainland China has continued to
decrease, from 57% on 14 March, to 29% on 22
March 2020.1,2
The number of new cases reported outside
of mainland China has continued or rapidly
increase. The total number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases reported by 174 countries, ter-
ritories and areas outside mainland China in the
current reporting week has increased more than
threefold (n = 210,644) compared to the preced-
ing week (n = 61,518).1,2
Italy reported 25% (n =
53,578) of all cases outside of mainland China;
Spain reported 12% (n = 24,926); Germany
reported 10% (n = 21,463); the US reported 7%
(n = 15,219); and the Islamic Republic of Iran
reported 5% (n = 10,610). Forty countries, ter-
ritories and areas reported cases of COVID-19
for the first time in the past seven days. Of all
the countries, territories and areas outside of
mainland China with known transmission clas-
sification (n = 174), 59% (n = 103) have reported
local transmission of COVID-19.
Globally, there are very different epidem-
ics occurring in different countries, with the
trajectories of different countries’ outbreaks
after their first 100 cases showing remarkable
variation. Figure 8 highlights that for a number
of countries outside of mainland China which
have reported more than 100 cases, their rates
of increase continue to be quite substantial,
particularly Italy, Spain and the United States of
America. For several other countries or regions
including Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong
there continues to be a slow rate of increase in
their number of new cases, with the Republic of
Korea reporting very few new cases each day.
Globally, 12,783 deaths have been reported.
Almost three-quarters (74%; n = 9,517) of global
deaths have been reported by 174 countries,

territories and areas outside of mainland China.
Of the deaths reported outside of mainland
China, 51% (n = 4,827) were reported in Italy,
16% (n = 1,556) in the Islamic Republic of
Iran, and 14% (n = 1,326) in Spain.1
The global
proportion of cases that are reported to have
died is 4.4%. This proportion is likely to be an
overestimate due to the likely variable levels of
under-ascertainment of cases, especially those
with mild infections. There is wide variation in
this proportion globally, with countries such as
Italy (9.0%), the Islamic Republic of Iran (7.5%)
and Spain (5.3%) reporting substantially higher
proportions.
Epidemiological features of COVID-19
The current estimates on epidemiological param-
eters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.
Transmission
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2
is via droplets and fomites from an infected
person to a close contact.3
COVID-19 can often
present as a common cold-like illness where the
virus is shed for a prolonged time after symp-
toms end, including in stools.4
A virological
analysis of nine hospitalised cases found active
virus replication in upper respiratory tract tis-
sues, with pharyngeal virus shedding very high
during the first week of symptoms.4
However,
current evidence does not support airborne or
faecal-oral spread as major factors in transmis-
sion.3
A study in China showed household contacts
and those who travelled with a confirmed
COVID-19 case were strongly associated with
an increased risk of infection.5
The study also
examined the average time from symptom onset
to disease confirmation among cases who were
identified through contact-based surveillance
(i.e. monitoring and testing of close contacts
of confirmed COVID-19 cases) and symptom-
based surveillance (i.e. symptomatic screening
at airports, community fever monitoring and
testing of hospital patients). Cases identified
through contact-based surveillance were associ-
ated with a 2.3 day decrease from symptom onset
to disease confirmation and a 1.9 day decrease
from symptom onset to isolation, compared to
cases found by symptom-based surveillance.
Modelling studies suggest that undocumented
infections are the source for over three-quarters
of documented cases and effective contact trac-
ing increases the probability of control.5,6
Infection of a dog with SARS-CoV-2 has been
reported to the International Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE) on two occasions since
the outbreak began.7
Both dogs were in Hong
Kong and had close contact with owners with
COVID-19. Neither dog showed clinical signs
of infection and there is no evidence that dogs
play a role in disease spread. Further studies are
underway to understand if and how different
animal species could be affected by COVID-19.
Incubation period
Estimates of median incubation period, based
on seven published studies, are 5 to 6 days
(ranging from 0 to 14 days).8
Patients with long
incubation periods do occasionally occur, how-
ever they are likely to be ‘outliers’ who should be
studied further but are unlikely to represent a
change in epidemiology of the virus.8
Molecular epidemiology
The initial COVID-19 cases were reported in
late December 2019 following the discovery
of a cluster of pneumonia cases at the Huanan
Seafood Market in Wuhan China. However,
subsequent work has identified SARS-CoV-2
cases as early as 1 December 2019 in Wuhan.9
Additionally, a phylogenetic analysis of whole
genome sequences has dated the emergence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans to between
late November and early December 2019.10
Since
December 2019, the virus has diversified into
multiple lineages as it has spread globally with
some degree of geographical clustering (Figure
9). The whole genome sequences currently avail-

able from Australian cases (n=25) are mostly
in returned travellers from China, the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Europe and the USA, and
thereby reflect this global diversity (Figure 9).
Recent work describes an emerging clade linked
to the epidemic in the Islamic Republic of Iran,11
which highlights how genomic epidemiology
can shed light on un-sampled locations. The
high number of independent introduction events
within Australia from Europe is also striking.
Continuing these analyses as more data from
Australia become available will corroborate and
query field data on the epidemiological links
among clusters within and between jurisdic-
tions.
Clinical features
A recently published meta-analysis supports
previous research that COVID-19 presents as
mild illness in the majority of cases with fever
and cough being the most commonly reported
symptoms. Severe or fatal outcomes tend to
occur in the elderly or those with comorbid
conditions.3,12
Some COVID-19 patients show neurological
signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting.
There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 viruses are
not always confined to the respiratory tract and
may invade the central nervous system inducing
neurological symptoms.13
As such, it is possible
that invasion of the central nervous system is
partially responsible for the acute respiratory
failure of COVID-19 patients.13
Examination of cases and their close contacts
in China found a positive association between
age and time from symptom onset to recovery.
Median time to recovery was estimated to be 27
days in 20–29 year olds, 32 days in 50–59 year
olds, and 36 days in those aged over 70 years.
The study also found an association between
clinical severity and time from symptom onset
to time to recovery. Compared to people with
mild disease, those with moderate and severe
disease were associated with a 19% and 58%
increase in time to recovery, respectively.5
A retrospective cohort study looking at risk fac-
tors for mortality among patients with COVID-
19 who have experienced a definite outcome
found an increase in the odds of in-hospital
death associated with older age, higher sequen-
tial organ failure assessment score and elevated
blood d-dimer levels on admission.14
Detectable
SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of
20 days in survivors and until death in non-
survivors.14
Treatment
Current clinical management of COVID-19
cases focuses on early recognition, isolation,
appropriate infection control measures and
provision of supportive care.15
Whilst there is
no specific antiviral treatment currently recom-
mendedforpatientswithsuspectedorconfirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, multiple clinical trials
are underway to evaluate a number of thera-
peutic agents, including remdesivir, lopinavir/
ritonavir, and chloroquine.16
Public health response
A summary of the key events that have been
associated with the emergence of COVID-19,
including Australia’s public health response
activities is provided at Figure 10. Since COVID-
19 first emerged internationally, public health
responses in Australia have continued to evolve
with the changing body of knowledge and epi-
demiological profile, both from overseas and in
Australia. During the current reporting period,
the Australian Health Protection Principal
Committee have issued advice to inform the
national public health response to the pandemic
including the broadening of the 14-day quaran-
tine requirement for all travellers from overseas,
regardless of the country, as well as physical
distancing measures.17

This report outlines what is known epidemio-
logically on COVID-19 in Australia and from
publicly available data from WHO Situation
Reports, other countries’ official updates and the
scientific literature. Data on domestic cases in
this report were collected from the NNDSS and
additionally informed by jurisdictional health
department media releases. The Communicable
Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) developed
the case definition for suspect and confirmed
cases, which was modified at different time
points during the outbreak (Table 2). Data were
analysed using Stata to describe the epidemiol-
ogy of COVID-19 in Australia and the progress
of the epidemic. Data for the international cases
of COVID-19 by country were compiled from
the latest WHO Situation Report. Case defini-
tions may vary by country making comparisons
difficult. Rapid reviews of the current state of
knowledge on COVID-19 were conducted from
the literature using PubMed.
