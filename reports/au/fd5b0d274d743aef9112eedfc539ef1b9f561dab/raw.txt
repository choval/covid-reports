Weekly epidemiological report

COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 5:
Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 29 February 2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team

Summary
This is the fifth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia
as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 29 February 2020. It includes data on COVID19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; acute
respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology; Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due to
the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every effort has
been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences between
jurisdictions.

In Australia:
• 25 COVID-19 cases were notified up until 19:00 AEDT 29 February 2020;
• The first 15 cases are all considered to have had a direct or indirect link to Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China;
• Nine cases were among the ‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship passengers repatriated from Japan
to the Northern Territory on 20 February 2020;
• The most recent case in Queensland had travelled from Iran;
• There were zero deaths at time of reporting;
• On 27 February 2020, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC)
recommended that the current travel restrictions for mainland China remain in place for a
further seven days; and
• On 29 February 2020, travel restrictions were announced for travellers from Iran.

Internationally:
• 85,403 infections have been confirmed globally, with 2,924 deaths;
• The majority of confirmed infections (93%; n = 79,251) and deaths (97%; n = 2,835) have
been reported in mainland China;
• On 26 February 2020, the number of cases reported in a 24 hour period from outside mainland China exceeded the number of cases from mainland China for the first time;
• All passengers from the ‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship have now disembarked and remaining staff will complete 14 days quarantine in Japan;
• Eighty-nine deaths were reported outside mainland China – 34 in Iran (Islamic Republic of),
21 in Italy, 17 in Republic of Korea, six associated with the ‘Diamond Princess’, five in Japan,
two each in Hong Kong and France and one each in the Philippines and Taiwan; and
• Republic of Korea, Italy and Iran are now reporting high levels of transmission.

Domestic cases
There were 25 confirmed cases reported in
Australia as at 19:00 AEDT 29 February 2020
(Table 1). Nine (36.0%) of the 25 confirmed cases
were among the ‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship
passengers repatriated from Japan (n=164) to the
Northern Territory on 20 February 2020. The
remaining cases were reported in New South
Wales (n = 4), Victoria (n = 4), Queensland (n =
6) and South Australia (n = 2). The first 15 cases
all had direct or indirect links to Wuhan. The
most recent case in Queensland had returned
from Iran and was the first Australian case not
linked to the outbreaks in Wuhan or on the
‘Diamond Princess’.1
The first case in Australia reported onset of
symptoms on 13 January 2020 (Figure 1). The
median age of all 25 reported Australian cases
was 53 years (range 8–79 years) with a maleto-female ratio of 1:1.3. The following analysis
involves 23 out of 25 cases who had detailed data
available at the time of reporting. Sixteen cases
(69.6%) reported fever, 12 cases (52.2%) reported
cough, and nine (39.1%) had a sore throat. Two
cases (8.7%) were reported to have pneumonia
and five (21.7%) reported diarrhoea. Four cases

2 of 14

had no symptoms recorded. Seven cases were
reported as having no comorbidities and one
case was reported as having diabetes. The first 15
cases have been reported to have recovered, and
no deaths were recorded at time of reporting.
Twenty cases had recorded onset of symptoms
prior to laboratory testing. The median time
between onset of symptoms and testing in
these cases was 2 days (range 0–10 days). From
these cases, those associated with the ‘Diamond
Princess’ (n = 6) had a median time between
onset of symptoms and testing of 2 days (range
0–5 days), whilst the remaining cases (n=14)
had a median time of 2.5 days (range 0–10 days)
between onset of symptoms and testing. The
slightly shorter time from symptom onset to
testing in the ‘Diamond Princess’ cohort may
be because they were under active surveillance
for COVID-19. Two cases were tested prior to
recorded onset of symptoms and one case did
not have a date of symptom onset or any symptoms recorded.
No cases have been detected among Australians
who have returned from mainland China
since 1 February 2020 or among students from
mainland China.2 Evidence of limited second-

ary transmission of COVID-19 in Australia is
thought to have occurred for three cases who
were part of a five-person cluster identified in
Queensland. There is currently no evidence of
community transmission within Australia.

International cases
As at 19:00 AEDT 29 February 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) was
85,403 globally (Table 2). Whilst mainland
China reported 92.8% of cases (n = 79,251), this
is a decrease from 98.1% on 22 February 2020
as the proportion of new cases reported from
outside of mainland China increased over the
last week. On 26 February 2020, the number of
new cases outside of mainland China exceeded
the number reported from mainland China for
the first time and this trend has continued to
date (Figure 2). Fifty-six countries and Special
Administrative Regions outside of mainland
China have reported a total of 5,447 confirmed
COVID-19 cases. There were an additional 705
confirmed cases on the cruise ship ‘Diamond
Princess’. Republic of Korea reported 51.2% of
all cases outside of mainland China (n = 3,150),
Italy reported 14.4% (n = 888), Iran (Islamic
Republic of) 6.3% (n = 388) and Japan 3.7% (n
= 230).3

Twenty-five new countries or Member States
(Afghanistan, Algeria, Austria, Bahrain,
Belarus, Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia,
Georgia, Greece, Iraq, Kuwait, Lithuania,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria,
Norway, North Macedonia, Oman, Pakistan,
Romania, San Marino, Switzerland) reported
cases of COVID-19 in the past seven days.
Eastern Mediterranean and European regions
had the greatest growth in number of new countries reporting cases. The first African and South
American countries reported cases over the last
seven days. Two new countries (Croatia and San
Marino) have reported possible or confirmed
limited local transmission since the last report
on 22 February 2020. Reports suggest sustained
local transmission is evident in Republic of
Korea, Italy and Iran. Vietnam, Philippines,
Cambodia, Russia, Belgium, India, Nepal, Sri
Lanka, and Egypt have not reported any new
cases for at least 14 days.3
Globally, 2,924 deaths have been reported, with
93.3% (n = 2,727) reported from Hubei Province,
China. Eighty-nine deaths were reported outside mainland China: 34 in Iran, 21 in Italy, 17
in Republic of Korea, six from the ‘Diamond
Princess’, five in Japan, two each in Hong Kong
and France and one each in the Philippines and
Taiwan.3

Background
On 31 December 2019, the World Health
Organization (WHO) were notified about a large
number of cases of pneumonia of unknown
origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
Chinese authorities isolated and identified a
novel coronavirus on 7 January 2020.4 WHO
declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.5 From 1 February
2020, Australia denied entry to anyone who had
left or transited through mainland China, with
the exception of Australian citizens, permanent
residents and their immediate family and air
crew who have been using appropriate personal
protective equipment.6 The Australian Health
Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC)
have reviewed these restrictions weekly, and
on 27 February 2020, they released a statement recommending current travel restrictions remain in place for a further seven days.2
AHPPC acknowledged that while there has been

health.gov.au/cdi

a decrease in number of cases being reported in
mainland China (outside of Hubei Province),
there is an increasing risk of sustained transmission being established in several other
countries.2 On the same day, the Australian
Prime Minister announced the activation of the
Australian Health Sector Emergency Response
Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).7 On
the 29 February 2020, the Minister for Health
announced travel restrictions for travellers
coming from Iran. From 1 March 2020 those
who are neither Australian citizens nor permanent residents will be prevented from coming
to Australia until 14 days after leaving Iran.
Australian citizens, permanent residents and
their immediate family will be required to selfisolate on return from Iran.8
The current estimates on epidemiological parameters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.

Country in focus: Republic of Korea
Republic of Korea notified their first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 20 January 2020. Of the
first 30 cases, 10 had direct links to Wuhan and 13 were close or family contacts of confirmed
cases. On 19 February 2020, 20 new cases were notified. Fifteen of these had an epidemiological link through the Shincheonji Church of Jesus to a case identified the day prior. From then,
reported cases in Republic of Korea rose rapidly with an increase of nearly twentyfive-fold over
the next week to 26 February 2020 (n = 1,261).9
Cases have been concentrated in Daegu city, primarily linked to the Shincheonji Church of
Jesus. As of 29 February 2020, 66.0% of cases in Daegu city were directly associated with the
Shincheonji Church of Jesus and 53.1% of all confirmed cases in Republic of Korea were associated with this church.10 The Shincheonji Church of Jesus is reported to have over 1,000 churches
across the Republic of Korea. Church services are reported to involve close physical proximity
to others and frequent loud calling out, which may contribute to the rapid spread of COVID-19
amongst members. There are media reports that the church is secretive and members may be
unlikely to disclose their membership to contacts, making contact tracing difficult.11
There have been clusters associated with the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital, an Israel pilgrimage,
the Busan Onchun church, and community centres and shelters in Gyeong-buk Province. Only
1.1% of cases reported up until 29 February 2020 in Republic of Korea have been attributed to
imported disease.10
The first death in Republic of Korea was reported on 20 February 2020.12 As of 29 February
2020, 17 deaths had been reported.13 Epidemiological analysis of the first 16 reported fatal cases
conducted by Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) found 14 (87.5%) were
aged over 50 years (range 35–93 years). The ratio of males to females was 1:0.6. All cases were
reported as having comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, chronic liver or kidney disease
and cancer. The seven cases associated with Cheongdo Daenam hospital cluster were all long
term admissions in the mental health ward which the KCDC felt might have contributed to poor
health and susceptibility to severe COVID-19.10
Republic of Korea has tested over 85,000 people for SARS-CoV-2. This extensive testing effort
has likely contributed to the identification of large numbers of COVID-19 cases. On 24 February
2020, the Republic of Korea government raised the alert level to the highest level in preparation for possible nationwide transmission.14 The KCDC has made recommendations to avoid
large gatherings, particularly for those aged over 65 years. Potential contacts are encouraged to
self-isolate with testing once they become symptomatic. Now with large numbers of cases and
sustained community transmission, the KCDC has advised that medical resources need to focus
on those with comorbid conditions and the elderly to minimise fatalities. Local governments
have now taken over epidemiological investigations and quarantine measures from the KCDC.10

Severity
Ongoing evidence from China supports previous
research that COVID-19 presents as mild illness
in the majority of cases with fever and cough the
most commonly reported symptoms. Severe or
fatal outcomes tend to occur in the elderly or
those with comorbid conditions.16 Reports from
cases in Republic of Korea suggest that their
experience is similar.9 Examination of cases in
China found the median time from onset to
resolution of symptoms was two weeks for those
with mild disease and three to six weeks for
severe or critical disease. Severe disease tended
to develop one week after onset of symptoms
and in fatal cases, time from onset of symptoms
to death was two to eight weeks.16
Calculated case fatality rates (CFR) have varied
depending on location across China and in

health.gov.au/cdi

countries outside China. Ji et al found a significant correlation between mortality rate and
population case load in China. They discussed
that the high and rapid escalation of disease
may have quickly overwhelmed health services
and been a contributing factor to Hubei’s high
case fatality rate (CFR).17 In the wealthy and
developed province of Zhejiang, the zero fatality
rate despite the large number of cases might be
due to well-resourced and accessible healthcare
facilities.17 These findings suggest that delaying the onset of the outbreak and slowing the
escalation of cases may allow health authorities
in countries not yet reporting sustained community transmission to better prepare for and
adapt to manage increasing numbers of cases.
However, resource–limited regions might be
overwhelmed earlier and at a lower number of
cases.

A small case series from China has described
four cases who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
five to 13 days after meeting the criteria for
hospital discharge. The criteria for hospital
discharge included: normal temperature for
at least 3 days; resolved respiratory symptoms;
substantially improved acute exudative lesions
on chest computed tomography (CT scan); and
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) negative on at least two consecutive
specimens separated by at least one day. Three
repeat RT-PCR tests were performed in the next
four to five days for each patient, all of whom
remained asymptomatic, and all returned
positive.18 The Australian Series of National
Guidelines for COVID-19 acknowledges that a
small proportion of people may have an illness
that has completely resolved but their respiratory specimens remain persistently PCR positive. The guideline recommends that a decision
to release these patients from isolation should be
made on a case-by-case basis and that a follow
up should take place seven days after release
from isolation for clinical review to ensure full
symptom resolution.19

Transmission
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2
is via droplets and fomites from an infected
person to a close contact.16 Reports from China,
Republic of Korea and Australia of clusters
within family and close social groups support
this.16,20 Current evidence does not support airborne or faecal-oral spread as major factors in
transmission.16

the following major recommendations for countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of
COVID-19:16
1. Immediately activate the highest level of
national Response Management protocols to
ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19
with non-pharmaceutical public health
measures;
2. Prioritise active, exhaustive case finding and
immediate testing and isolation, painstaking
contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of
close contacts;
3. Fully educate the general public on the
seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in
preventing its spread;
4. Immediately expand surveillance to detect
COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias,
conducting screening in some patients with
upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent
COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for
the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance
systems (e.g. systems for influenza-likeillness); and
5. Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and
simulations for the deployment of even more
stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (e.g. the suspension
of large-scale gatherings and the closure of
schools and workplaces).

Incubation period

Treatment

No new research has been published on the
incubation period for COVID-19. Please refer to
COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 4.21

Current clinical management of COVID-19
cases focuses on early recognition, isolation,
appropriate infection control measures and
provision of supportive care.22 Whilst there is
no specific antiviral treatment currently recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are multiple clinical trials underway in China and the US have

Suspect Case

Confirmed Case

If the patient satisfies epidemiological
and clinical criteria, they are classified as
a suspect case.
Epidemiological criteria
• Travel to (including transit through)
mainland China in the 14 days
before the onset of illness.
OR
• Close or casual contact in 14 days
before illness onset with a confirmed
case of COVID-19.
Clinical criteria
• Fever
OR
• Acute respiratory infection (e.g.
shortness of breath or cough) with
or without fever.

A person who tests positive to a
validated specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic
acid test or has the virus identified by
electron microscopy or viral culture.

begun a clinical trial evaluating Remdesivir, an
antiviral developed for the treatment of Ebola
virus disease.23

Testing
The North West London National Health Service
(NHS) Trust has implemented a pilot program
of home testing of potential cases. Those identified as potential cases by general practitioners,
emergency departments or via the NHS hotline
are referred to the program. Cases are triaged
over the phone before a trained healthcare professional in personal protective equipment goes
to the person’s house to collect the specimen and
provide education on self-isolation, advice on
what to do if they deteriorate and an emergency
contact number. The potential case is then contacted with the results and if the result is positive they are admitted to hospital.24 The aim of
the program is to reduce the risk of ambulance
services and emergency waiting rooms being
overwhelmed with potential cases and reduce
the risk of disease transmission to potentially
vulnerable populations within healthcare settings whilst still allowing for early identification
and isolation of cases.

Virology
Several countries have isolated and sequenced
the genome for SARS-CoV-2 from cases with
COVID-19. Analysis of the genetic diversity of
these samples found few mutations, suggesting that following initial animal-to-human
transmission from a single source, spread has
resulted from human-to-human transmission
over a limited period of time. Based on modelling, researchers estimate that initial human
infection was in November to early December
2019. Groups of sequences with the same mutations are being identified, confirming humanto-human transmission and linking cases across
countries.25 Ongoing surveillance of sequences
and shared mutations will assist with understanding of the global spread of the virus.

System (NNDSS) and state and territory health
department media releases. The Communicable
Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) developed
the case definition for suspected and confirmed
cases, which was modified at different time
points in the epidemic (Table 3). Based on this
guidance, state and territory health department
investigators conducted interviews of suspected
cases to collect core and enhanced data for inclusion in the NNDSS. Data was analysed using
Stata to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19
in Australia and the progress of the epidemic.
Data for the international cases of COVID-19
by country were compiled from the latest WHO
Situation Report. Case definitions may vary by
country making comparisons difficult. Rapid
reviews of the current state of knowledge on
COVID-19 were conducted from the literature
using PubMed.
