Weekly epidemiological report

COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 4:
Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 22 February 2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team

Summary
This is the fourth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in
Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 22 February 2020. It includes data on
COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; acute
respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology; Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due to
the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every effort
has been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences
between jurisdictions.
In Australia:

Internationally:

• 22 COVID-19 cases were notified up until
19:00 AEDT 22 February 2020;

• 77,794 infections have been confirmed globally, with 2,359 deaths;

• The first 15 cases are all considered to have
had a direct or indirect link to Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China;

• The majority of confirmed infections (98%;
n = 76,288) and deaths (99%; n = 2,345) have
been reported in mainland China;

• The seven most recent cases were among the
‘Diamond Princess’ passengers repatriated
on a flight from Japan to the Northern Territory on 20 February 2020;

• On 19 February 2020, the case reporting
from Hubei Province was revised to remove
cases that have been diagnosed clinically
without laboratory confirmation;

• Zero deaths were reported; and

• Fourteen deaths were reported outside mainland China – four in Iran (Islamic Republic
of), two each in Hong Kong SAR, Republic
of Korea and from the ‘Diamond Princess’
cruise ship, and one each in France, Japan,
the Philippines and Taiwan; and

• On 20 February 2020, the Australian
Health Protection Principal Committee
(AHPPC) issued a statement recommending that the current travel restrictions for
mainland China remain in place for a further
seven days.

health.gov.au/cdi

• Republic of Korea has reported a substantial
increase in confirmed cases. There were 318
confirmed cases in the current reporting
week compared to four cases reported in the
preceding week.

Domestic cases
There were 22 confirmed cases reported in
Australia as at 19:00 AEDT 22 February 2020
(Table 1). Seven of the 22 confirmed cases were
among the ‘Diamond Princess’ passengers (n =
164) repatriated on a flight from Japan to the
Northern Territory on 20 February 2020. The
remaining cases were reported in New South
Wales (n = 4), Victoria (n = 4), Queensland (n =
5) and South Australia (n = 2).
As at 19:00 AEDT 22 February 2020, details
were not available for the seven cases from the
‘Diamond Princess’. The following is therefore
a summary of the first 15 cases reported in
Australia. The first case in Australia reported
onset of signs and symptoms on 13 January 2020
(Figure 1). The median age of cases was 43 years
(range 8–66 years). The male-to-female ratio was
1.5:1. Fourteen cases (93%) reported fever and/
or chills, 11 cases (73%) reported cough, and
two cases were reported to have pneumonia.
Eleven (73%) of the 15 cases were hospitalised
for clinical management and infection control.
The remaining cases were assessed to be well
enough to self-isolate at home. At the time of
reporting, ten of these cases were reported to
have recovered. No deaths were reported.

Evidence of limited secondary transmission
of COVID-19 in Australia is thought to have
occurred for three cases who were part of a five
person cluster identified in Queensland. The
cluster of confirmed COVID-19 cases were part
of a small group of nine people from mainland
China that had been travelling together. The
initial case among this group was isolated upon
presentation to hospital, and all others in the
travel group were also quarantined. Four members of this group were subsequently confirmed
as cases. Of these, three cases were consistent
with secondary transmission from the initial
case due to their close contact prior to isolation.
The remaining case had been in Wuhan, Hubei
Province during the 14 days prior to illness onset
and was considered a co-primary case.

International cases
On 19 February 2020, the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China
removed the case classification of ‘clinically
diagnosed’ that had previously been used for
cases reported in Hubei Province. Confirmed
cases are those testing positive by RT-PCR or
gene sequencing.1 This change in reporting has
meant that some cases that had previously been
clinically diagnosed would now be removed as
they have since tested negative. This has resulted

in an apparent slowing of reported cases,
especially from Hubei Province in the current
reporting week.
As at 19:00 AEDT 22 February 2020, the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 77,794 globally (Table 2). Mainland China reported 98% of
cases (n = 76,288) and 2,345 deaths. Thirty-one
countries and Special Administrative Regions
outside of mainland China reported 872 confirmed COVID-19 cases. An additional 634
confirmed cases were associated with the cruise
ship ‘Diamond Princess’. Fourteen deaths were
reported outside mainland China: four in Iran
(Islamic Republic of), two each in Hong Kong
SAR, Republic of Korea and from the ‘Diamond
Princess’ cruise ship, and one each in France,
Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan.2 Seventeen
countries (Australia, Egypt, France, Germany,
Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of
Korea, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, UAE, UK,
USA and Vietnam) reported possible or confirmed limited local transmission.2

health.gov.au/cdi

There is growing evidence of sustained local
transmission in some countries. Over the
reporting week, the Republic of Korea had a
large increase in confirmed cases from 4 to 318.3
Cases were primarily from two clusters, one
linked to a church group and the other linked
to a hospital.4 Japan also reported an increase
in confirmed cases over the reporting week,
with the majority not linked to travel to Hubei
Province.5 Since the last reporting week, three
new countries (Lebanon, Iran and Israel) have
reported cases of COVID-19. Iran reported 18
cases and four deaths.2

Background
The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.6 Cases were initially associated with exposure to a wet market,
located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China,
indicating a possible zoonotic source. Sustained

human-to-human transmission is now occurring in the majority of provinces outside of
Hubei Province in China. In an effort to contain
the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities
imposed a lockdown on the city of Wuhan on 23
January 2020 – suspending all public transport
including international flights – and extended
the measure to neighbouring cities in Hubei
Province over subsequent days.7
Following advice from the Australian Health
Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) to
substantially reduce the volume of travellers
coming from mainland China, additional border
measures were implemented in Australia. From
1 February 2020, Australia denied entry to anyone who had left or transited through mainland
China, with the exception of Australian citizens,
permanent residents and their immediate family
and air crew who have been using appropriate
personal protective equipment.8 On 20 February
2020, AHPPC released a statement recommending current travel restrictions remain in place
for a further seven days.9 AHPPC noted the continuing growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths
in the Hubei Province of China, and acknowledged that, while there has been an apparent
slowing in case numbers in other provinces of
mainland China, it is unclear whether this slowing will continue as Chinese employees return
to work after the holiday period. Border measures to screen flights and vessels from mainland
China and for people who have come from or
transited through mainland China were also
recommended to continue.9
The current estimates on epidemiological parameters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.

Severity
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most
commonly reported symptoms are fever, cough,
fatigue and difficulty with breathing (dyspnoea).10–12 A large study of 44,672 confirmed
cases in China found that 80.9% had mild dis-

ease, with no pneumonia or mild pneumonia.13
The disease appeared to affect primarily adults,
with children aged less than 19 years making up
only 2–3% of reported cases.10,13 Children also
appeared to present with less severe disease.13
The case fatality rate (CFR) for China has been
calculated at 2.3%, based on 44,672 laboratoryconfirmed cases up to 11 February 2020. The
calculated CFR was much higher in Hubei
Province (2.9%) than in all other provinces
(0.4%). The CFR increased with increasing age
group, with the highest CFR observed among
those aged 80 years or older at 14.8%. No deaths
were reported in children aged less than 10
years. The CFR was calculated at 0.9% in those
reporting no comorbidities and 10.5% in cases
with cardiovascular disease; however, data on
comorbidities was missing for 53% of confirmed
cases. Cases classified as critical (respiratory
failure, septic shock, and/or multi-organ failure)
had a CFR of 49.0%.13 Critically ill patients who
died have been shown to be older and more likely
to have chronic comorbidities.12 CFR estimates
for regions outside mainland China are generally low; however, the clinical outcome for the
majority of these cases is not yet known.14
There are increasing reports of COVID-19 cases
who did not display any symptoms at the time of
testing.13,15-17 However, it is not always clear how
many continued to be asymptomatic. Among a
cohort of travellers repatriated to Germany on
1 February 2020, two travellers who were tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 showed no symptoms
at the time of testing. On review one was found
to have a faint rash and mild sore throat (pharyngitis). Both remained well and with no fever (afebrile) for seven days following isolation.16 Fiftyone per cent (n = 318) of the confirmed cases on
board the ‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship as of
21 February 2020 showed no symptoms at time
of specimen collection.17 Information about the
development of symptoms in these cases after
disembarkation was not available.

Transmission
The exact nature of transmission of SARS-CoV-2
is not well understood. Human-to-human
transmission is currently suspected to be via
droplets, contact and fomites, which is consistent with other coronaviruses.18 There have
been multiple reports of clusters within family
and closed social groups, which would support
this hypothesis.10,15,17 The WHO has recently
released protocols for research into community,
household and health facility transmission and
surface contamination to help further define
transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2.2
There continues to be a large variation in the
basic reproductive number (R0) calculated in
various studies depending on the assumptions
made and data set used. A recent review of 12
studies estimated the mean basic reproductive
number (R0) to be 3.28 and median R0 to be 2.79,
which exceeded the WHO preliminary R0 of
1.4–2.5 (average 1.95).19,20

Should confirmation of enteric infection and
faecal excretion of SARS-CoV-2 be confirmed, it
may have implications for transmission control.

Incubation period
WHO has revised the key epidemiologic
parameters of COVID-19 in collaboration with
an international network of statisticians and
mathematical modellers. These parameters were
calculated using data captured from COVID-19
surveillance activities and early investigations.
Preliminary estimates of median incubation
period, based on seven published studies, are 5
to 6 days (ranging from 0 to 14 days).14 Patients
with long incubation periods do occasionally
occur and have been reported, however medical
experts have described these patients as ‘outliers’ who should be studied further and do not
represent a significant shift in thinking about
the virus.

Recommendations for control

A small study analysing viral load in nasal
and throat swabs from 17 confirmed cases in
Guangdong, China found higher viral loads
detected soon after symptom onset, and in nasal
compared to throat swabs.21 This is a shedding
pattern similar to influenza illness rather than
SARS-CoV. Whilst there is currently no published evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
from an asymptomatic case, there is some evidence of potential infectivity of asymptomatic
cases based on viral load studies. For example,
the viral load detected in an asymptomatic
patient, from the Chinese cohort of 17 discussed
above, was similar to that in the symptomatic
patients.21 SARS-CoV-2 was also isolated from
samples in cell culture from asymptomatic
German nationals.16 The role played by asymptomatic cases in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is
still unclear.

The Australian Government Department of
Health and WHO recommend the general public reduce their exposure to and transmission of
COVID-19 by:

While diarrhoea has been reported as an uncommon symptom of COVID-19, a stool sample of
a US case tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.10,22

Treatment

health.gov.au/cdi

• Frequently cleaning hands with soap and
water or by using alcohol-based hand rub.
• When coughing and sneezing cover mouth
and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw
tissue away immediately and wash hands.
• Avoid close contact with anyone who has
fever and cough.
• If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
breathing seek medical care early and share
previous travel history with your health care
provider.

Current clinical management of COVID-19 cases
focuses on early recognition, isolation, appropriate infection control measures and provision of

antiviral treatment currently recommended for
patients with suspected or confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection, multiple drugs are being investigated. Experimental vaccines are also in development. University of Queensland researchers
recently reported making significant advances
towards a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.24

Virology
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,
is 96% identical to the whole genome sequence
of a known bat coronavirus (BATCoV RaTG13)
and 79.5% identical to SARS-CoV-1. Like SARSCoV-1, it attaches its spike (S) protein to the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) to
enter and infect host cells located in the lower
respiratory tract, with progressive respiratory
failure due to alveolar damage.25

Methods
Data for this report were current as at 19:00
hours AEDT, 22 February 2020.
This report outlines what is known epidemiologically on COVID-19 in Australia and from
publicly available data from WHO Situation
Reports, other countries’ official updates and
the scientific literature. Data on domestic cases

8 of 11

in this report were collected from the National
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
(NNDSS) and state and territory case investigation reports. The Communicable Diseases
Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case
definition for suspected and confirmed cases,
which was modified at different time points
in the epidemic (Table 3). CDNA developed
national guidance on investigating suspected
and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Based on this
guidance, state and territory health department
investigators conducted interviews of suspected
cases to collect core and enhanced data for inclusion in the NNDSS. Data was analysed using
Stata to describe the epidemiology of infections
in Australia and the progress of the epidemic.
Data for the international cases of COVID-19
by country were compiled from the latest WHO
Situation Report. Case definitions may vary by
country making comparisons difficult. Rapid
reviews of the current state of knowledge on
COVID-19 were conducted from the literature
using PubMed.
