Weekly epidemiological report
COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 11:
Reportingweekending23:59AEST12April2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team
Notified cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths reported to the National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System (NNDSS) to 12 April 2020.
Summary
The reduction in international travel, domestic
movement, social distancing measures and pub-
lic health action have likely slowed the spread of
the disease (Figure 1).
Notifications in Australia remain predomi-
nantly among people with recent overseas travel,
with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked
back to a confirmed case, with a small portion
unable to be epidemiologically linked. The dis-
tribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally
acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.

respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology; Australia
Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 12 April
2020i
Notifications 6,394
Deaths 46
Internationally, cases continue to increase. The
rates of increase have started to slow in several
regions, although it is too soon to tell whether
this trend will be sustained. The epidemiology
differs from country to country depending not
only on the disease, but also on differences in
case detection, testing and implemented public
health measures.

Australian cases: descriptive
epidemiology
National trends
• Over the past week, 589 cases of COVID-19
were notified to the NNDSS, bringing the
total number of confirmed cases notified in
Australia to 6,394 (up to 23:59 AEST 12 April
2020). This is a 65% decrease in weekly new
cases compared to the previous reporting
period (n = 1,646);
• The median time between onset of symptoms
and laboratory testing was 3 days (interquar-
tile range: 1–6 days); and
• Forty-four cases (0.7%) have been reported
in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
persons since the start of the outbreak. These
cases were reported across several jurisdic-
tions, with the majority reported in areas
classified as ‘major cities of Australia’ based
on the case’s usual place of residence. Across
all Australian cases, completeness of the In-
digenous status field was approximately 78%;
22% of cases had a reported value of ‘not
stated’ or had no information provided.
Geographical distribution
• Cases of COVID-19 continue to be reported
at varying rates in all jurisdictions (Table 1);
• New South Wales had the highest rate of
COVID-19 notifications (35.4 per 100,000)
and the Northern Territory had the lowest
(11.0 per 100,000);
• The majority of new cases continue to be re-
ported in New South Wales and Victoria over
this past week. No cases were reported from
the Northern Territory during this reporting
period; and
• Most cases over the past fortnight were re-
ported to reside in major metropolitan areas,
with a small number of cases residing outside
these areas (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
Age and gender distribution
• Cases of COVID-19 were reported across all
age groups. The median age of all COVID-19
cases was 47 years (interquartile range: 29–62
years) (Figure 4);
• The number of cases was highest in the
20–29 years age group;
• The highest rate of disease was among those
in the 60–69 years age group, followed closely
by the 70 – 79 years age group (Figure 5);
• Children make up a very small proportion
of cases nationally with 1% aged less than 10
years and 3% aged 10 – 19 years; and
• Notifications by gender were approximately
equal, although there was some variation
across age groups.
Source of infection
• To date, most of the reported COVID-19
cases in Australia acquired their infection
overseas;
• Of cases with a reported place of acquisition,
65% had a recent international travel history
and 33% were considered to have been lo-
cally acquired (Figure 6):
◦
◦ The majority of overseas-acquired cases
reported a travel history to the Euro-
pean Region, the Americas Region or on
board cruise ships (Figure 7);
◦
◦ Of the locally-acquired cases, most were
considered to be contacts of a confirmed
case, with a very small proportion of
cases not able to be epidemiologically
linked to a confirmed case; and
◦
◦ Cases where a place of acquisition has
not been reported (1.3%) are currently
under public health investigation.

Cluster and outbreak investigations
Investigations are taking place in states and
territories in relation to a number of clusters
and outbreaks of COVID-19. To date the larg-
est outbreaks have been associated with cruise
ships, with some other large domestic clusters
associated with healthcare facilities and private
functions, such as weddings.
Cruise ships account for a substantial propor-
tion of cases of COVID-19 in Australia. Of cases
with a reported place of acquisition, 17% (n =
950) were acquired at sea on a cruise ship. This is
a 5% increase in COVID-19 cases acquired on a
cruise ship since the last reporting period. There
have been 17 deaths among cases acquired on
cruise ships in Australia.
As reported by states and territories on 11
April 2020, there were 21 known clusters or
outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring in healthcare
settings and approximately 481 cases in health-
care workers, with no such cases occurring in
the Northern Territory. Where jurisdictions
reported source of infection, 79% (244/307) of
healthcare workers acquired their infection
outside of the healthcare settings, such as from
travel overseas or a household contact.
Cluster:
• The term ‘cluster’ in relation to COVID-19 refers to two or more cases that are epidemiologi-
cally related in time, place or person where a common source (such as an event or within a
community) of infection is suspected but not yet established.
Outbreak:
• The term ‘outbreak’ in relation to COVID-19 refers to two or more cases among a specific
group of people and/or over a specific period of time where illness is associated with a com-
mon source (such as an event or within a community).

Symptom profile
• Of the symptoms reported, cough (70%) was
the most common (Figure 8);
• Forty-eight percent of cases reported fever,
40% reported sore throat, and 36% reported
headache. Only 4% or fewer of all cases re-
ported either pneumonia or acute respiratory
disease (ARD); and
• In addition, loss of taste was reported from
438 cases and loss of smell from 443 cases.
These conditions were reported in at least
8% of cases, noting that this is currently not
a standard field in NNDSS, and is likely to
under-represent those presenting with these
symptoms.
Severity
• Of total cases of COVID-19 (n = 6,394)
notified, 12% (n = 752) were admitted to
hospital:
◦
◦ The median age of hospitalised cases
was 60 years (interquartile range: 40–72
years), with the highest proportion of
hospitalised cases in the 60–69 years and
70–79 years age groups;
◦
◦ The most commonly reported comorbid
conditions among hospitalised cases
were cardiac disease and diabetes (each
20%);
• Of the hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 17%
(n = 127) were admitted to an intensive care
unit (ICU), with 36 cases requiring ventila-
tion;
• Forty-six COVID-19 deaths were confirmed
in Australia up to 12 April 2020:
◦
◦ The median age of cases who died was
78.5 years (interquartile range: 74–83
years);
◦
◦ 28 of the cases were male and 18 were
female; and
◦
◦ The most commonly reported comorbid
conditions among COVID-19 deaths
were diabetes (33%), chronic respiratory
disease (30%) and cardiac disease (30%).
Public health response
Since COVID-19 first emerged internationally,
Australia has implemented public health meas-
ures in response to the disease’s epidemiology,
both overseas and in Australia. These measures
are focused on restrictions on domestic and
international travel and public gatherings; pri-
orities for testing and quarantining of suspected
cases and close contacts; guidance on effective
social distancing; and the protection of vulner-
able populations such as those in residential
care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander communities. Key aspects of
Australia’s evolving public health response are
summarised in Table 2.
During the current reporting period, the
Australian Health Protection Principal
Committee (AHPPC) has issued advice to
inform the national public health response to the
pandemic including: treatment and prophylaxis
of COVID-19, healthcare worker use of PPE,
home isolation, organ donation and transplant,
rapid point of care tests, and updated quaran-
tine arrangements for noncruise maritime and
air crew.

International situation4
• As at 23:59 AEST 12 April 2020, the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) was
1,696,588 globally;
• The number of new cases reported globally
increased by 50% since last week. This has
declined from a 79% increase in the previous
week. However, it is too soon to tell whether
this trend will be sustained;
• COVID-19 was reported across a total of 213
countries, territories and areas;
• The reported epidemiology varies by country
with different trajectories of outbreaks after
their first 100 cases. Figure 9 highlights that
for a number of countries outside of main-
land China which have reported more than
100 cases, their rates of increase continue to
be high, particularly USA, Spain and Italy,
although at a slower rate than the previous
week. For Singapore and Japan, there contin-
ues to be a slow but steady rate of increase in
their number of new cases, while the Re-
public of Korea and Hong Kong are report-
ing very few new cases each day. Reported
case numbers will be influenced by rates of
testing, case definition, and case detection as
well as overall health system capacity;
• Globally, 105,952 deaths have been reported.
The risk of death is reported to increase with
age;
• The case fatality rate is reported as ap-
proximately 6%. This is highly likely to be an
overestimate due to variable levels of under-
ascertainment of cases, especially those with
mild infections and presence of a comorbid
condition such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disease and chronic respiratory disease; and
• Of all deaths reported globally, over half have
been from Italy (18%), USA (17%) and Spain
(15%). For several other countries or regions
including Japan and Republic of Korea, there
continues to be a slow increase in their num-
ber of deaths, with both countries reporting
few new deaths each day, which is consist-
ent with their broader epidemic case trends
(Figure 10).
Background
The current estimates on epidemiological
parameters including severity, transmissibility
and incubation period are uncertain. Estimates
are likely to change as more information
becomes available.
Transmission
• Human-to-human transmission of SARS-
CoV-2 is via droplets and fomites from an
infected person to a close contact;5
• A virological analysis of nine hospitalised
cases found active virus replication in up-
per respiratory tract tissues, with pharyn-
geal virus shedding during the first week of
symptoms. However, current evidence does
not support airborne or faecal-oral spread as
major factors in transmission;
• A study in China showed an association
between household contacts and travel with a
confirmed COVID-19 case and an increased
risk of infection;6
and
• A recent study suggests that children do not
play a key role in household transmission
and are unlikely to be the primary source of
household infections.7
Incubation period
• Estimates of median incubation period,
based on seven published studies, are 5 to
6 days (ranging from 0 to 14 days). Patients
with long incubation periods do occasionally
occur, however they are likely to be ‘outliers’
who should be studied further but are un-
likely to represent a change in epidemiology
of the virus.8,9

Molecular epidemiology
• Since December 2019, the virus has diversi-
fied into multiple lineages as it has spread
globally with some degree of geographical
clustering;
• The whole genome sequences currently
available from Australian cases are mostly in
returned travellers from China, the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Europe and the USA, and
thereby reflect this global diversity; and
• Recent work describes an emerging clade
linked to the epidemic in the Islamic Repub-
lic of Iran.10
Clinical features
• COVID-19 presents as mild illness in the
majority of cases with cough and fever being
the most commonly reported symptoms.
Severe or fatal outcomes are more likely to
occur in the elderly or those with comorbid
conditions;5,11
• Some COVID-19 patients show neurological
signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting.
There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 viruses
are not always confined to the respiratory
tract and may invade the central nervous
system inducing neurological symptoms. As
such, it is possible that invasion of the central
nervous system is partially responsible for
the acute respiratory failure of COVID-19
patients;12
• There is some evidence to suggest that im-
pairment or loss of the sense of smell (hypos-
mia/anosmia) or taste (hypoguesia/aguesia)
is associated with COVID-19.13,14
This is
supported by research finding a biological
mechanism for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to
cause olfactory dysfunction;15,16
• Examination of cases and their close con-
tacts in China found a positive association
between age and time from symptom onset
to recovery. The study also found an associa-
tion between clinical severity and time from
symptom onset to time to recovery. Com-
pared to people with mild disease, those with
moderate and severe disease were associ-
ated with a 19% and 58% increase in time to
recovery, respectively;6
• Several studies have identified cardiovascu-
lar implications resulting from COVID-19.
Vascular inflammation has been observed
in a number of cases and may be a potential
mechanism for myocardial injury which can
result in cardiac dysfunction and arrhyth-
mias; and
• Recently published literature outside of
Wuhan found that approximately 10% of all
cases developed gastrointestinal symptoms
associated with COVID-19 infection either
on admission or during hospitalisation.17,18
This number is higher than the 3% previ-
ously reported in Wuhan.
Treatment
• Current clinical management of COVID-19
cases focuses on early recognition, isolation,
appropriate infection control measures and
provision of supportive care.19
Whilst there
is no specific antiviral treatment currently
recommended for patients with suspected
or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, mul-
tiple clinical trials are underway to evaluate
a number of therapeutic agents, including
remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and chloro-
quine.20
Data considerations

Appendix A: Frequently asked
questions
Q: Can I request access to the COVID-19 data
behind your CDI weekly reports?
A: National notification data on COVID-19 con-
firmed cases is collated in the National Notifiable
Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) based on
notifications made to state and territory health
authorities under the provisions of their relevant
public health legislation.
Normally, requests for the release of data from the
NNDSS requires agreement from states and ter-
ritories via the Communicable Diseases Network
Australia, and, depending on the sensitivity of the
data sought and proposed, ethics approval may also
be required.
Due to the COVID-19 response, unfortunately, spe-
cific requests for NNDSS data have been put on hold.
We are currently looking into options to be able to
respond to data requests in the near future.
We will continue to publish regular summaries and
analyses of the NNDSS dataset and recommend the
following resources be referred to in the meantime:
• NNDSS summary tables: http://www9.
health.gov.au/cda/source/cda-index.cfm
• Daily case summary of cases: https://www.
health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-
coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/corona-

• Communicable Diseases Intelligence COV-
ID-19 weekly epidemiology report: https://
www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publish-
ing.nsf/Content/novel_coronavirus_2019_
ncov_weekly_epidemiology_reports_aus-
tralia_2020.htm
• State and territory public health websites.
Q: Can I request access to data at post-code
level of confirmed cases?
A: Data at this level cannot be released without eth-
ics approval and permission would need to be sought
from all states and territories via the Communicable
Diseases Network Australia. As noted above, specific
requests for NNDSS data are currently on hold.
A GIS/mapping analysis of cases will be included
in each Communicable Diseases Intelligence
COVID-19 weekly epidemiology report. In order to
protect privacy of confirmed cases, data in this map
will be presented at SA3 level.
Q. Where can I find more detailed data on
COVID-19 cases?
A: We are currently looking into ways to provide
more in-depth epidemiological analyses of COVID-
19 cases, with regard to transmission and severity,
including hospitalisation. These analyses will
continue to be built upon in future iterations of
the weekly Communicable Diseases Intelligence
report.
