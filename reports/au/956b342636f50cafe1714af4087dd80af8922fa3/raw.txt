Weekly epidemiological report
COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 7:
Reportingweekending19:00AEDT14March2020
COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team
Summary
This is the seventh epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in
Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 14 March 2020. It includes data on
COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; acute
respiratory disease; case definition; epidemiology; Australia
The following epidemiological data are subject to change both domestically and internationally due to
the rapidly evolving situation. Australian cases are still under active investigation. While every effort has
been made to standardise the investigation of cases nationally, there may be some differences between
jurisdictions.
Domestic cases
There were 295 confirmed cases, including three
deaths, reported in Australia as at 19:00 AEDT
14 March 2020 (Table 1). Of the 295 confirmed
cases, 51.5% (n = 152) were reported in NSW,
18.6% (n = 55) from Qld, 15.6% (n = 46) from
Vic, 7.1% (n = 21) from SA, 4.7% (n = 14) from
WA, 2% (n = 6) from Tas, and 0.3% (n = 1) from
ACT (Figure 1).
Of the 295 confirmed cases reported in the
National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance
System (NNDSS), 86% (n = 253) reported a place
of acquisition and 14% (n = 42) remain under
investigation. Of reported place of acquisition,
66% (n = 166) had a recent travel history and
34% (n = 87) were locally acquired. Of cases that
reported recent travel history, 22% (n = 36) have
a direct link to USA, 11% (n = 18) have a direct
link to Italy, 9% (n = 15) have a direct link to
Iran, 8% (n = 13) have a direct link to the UK,
8% (n = 13) have a direct link to China, 6% (n =
10) were passengers on the ‘Diamond Princess’
cruise ship repatriated from Japan, and 37% (n
= 61) have a recent travel history to other coun-
tries.
Of the 34% (n = 87) of cases that were locally
acquired, 75% (n = 65) were from NSW, 9% (n =
8) from Qld, 9% (n = 8) from SA, 2% (n = 2) from
WA, 2% (n = 2) from Vic, 1% (n = 1) from ACT
and 1% (n = 1) from Tas.
There were three reported deaths as of 14
March 2020, one associated with the ‘Diamond
Princess’ cruise ship, and two who were part of
the same aged care facility cluster in NSW.
The median age of all 295 reported Australian
cases was 47 years (range 0–94 years), with the
highest proportion of cases aged 50–59 and
60–69 years (Figure 2). The male-to-female ratio
was approximately 1:1. All three cases that were
reported to have died were aged over 70 years.
Of the 295 confirmed cases, 76% (n = 225) had
hospitalisation data reported (Figure 3). Of those

have a reported place of acquisition and 14% (n = 42) remain under investigation;
◦
◦ Of reported places of acquisition, 66% (n = 166) had a recent overseas travel history and 34%
(n = 87) were locally acquired. 14% (n = 42) are pending investigation;
◦
◦ Of reported recent overseas travel history:
◦
◦ 22% (n = 36) have a direct link to USA;
◦
◦ 11% (n = 18) have a direct link to Italy;

◦
◦ 6% (n = 10) are associated with the ‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship passengers repatriated
from Japan;
◦
◦ 37% (n = 61) have a recent travel history to other countries;
• Of the three reported deaths, one was associated with the ‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship, and two
were part of the same aged care facility cluster; and
• Since the last report, AHPPC have provided further recommendations on public events, travel
restrictions, work restrictions for health and aged care workers, and public gatherings and testing.
Internationally:
• 142,539 infections have been confirmed globally, with 5,393 deaths;
• The majority of confirmed infections (57%; n = 81,021) and deaths (59%; n = 3,194) have been
reported in mainland China;
• Outside of mainland China, cases (n = 61,518) have been reported in 134 countries, territories
and areas, with approximately 60% of those cases reported from three countries: Italy, the Islamic
Republic of Iran and Republic of Korea;
• Outside of mainland China, 2,199 deaths were reported by 35 countries, territories and areas; and
• The number of daily new cases reported in mainland China has continued to decrease as cases
increase in other countries, territories and areas globally.

cases, 36% (n = 80) were hospitalised, 43% (n =
97) were not hospitalised, and hospitalisation
status for 21% (n = 48) was unknown. The 60–64
age group reported the highest proportion of
hospitalisation at 13% (n = 10), followed by the
30–34 and 35–39 age groups both reporting 11%
(n = 9), and the 40–44 and 50–54 age groups
both reporting 10% (n = 8).
Of the 295 confirmed cases, 53% (n = 156)
reported symptoms (Table 2). A total of fifteen
symptoms were reported with fever being the
most commonly reported by 69% of cases (n =
108). Fifty-four percent (n = 84) reported cough,
46% (n = 72) reported sore throat, 35% (n =
55) reported shortness of breath, and 31% (n
= 48) reported diarrhoea. Only 1% of all cases
reported either joint pain, pneumonia or acute
respiratory disease (ARD).
Of the 295 confirmed cases, 14% (n = 42) did
not report place of acquisition and 2% (n = 5)
reported overseas acquisition but with country
unknown. Of the 248 cases with reported place
of acquisition and country level data, 65% (n =
161) were overseas acquired. Table 3 shows the
most common places of acquisition for returned
travellers were from countries in the European
Region (n = 54), Region of the Americas (n = 39)
and Western Pacific Region (n = 33). No place
of acquisition was reported from the African
Region. 4% of cases were acquired from the
‘Diamond Princess’ cruise ship under interna-
tional conveyance.
Eighty-seven cases in Australia (35%) were
locally acquired.

International cases
As at 19:00 AEDT 14 March 2020, the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to
the World Health Organization (WHO) was
142,539 globally.1
The proportion of total cases
reported from mainland China has continued to
decrease, from 79% on 7 March 2020 to 57% (n
= 81,021) on 14 March 2020.1,2
On 26 February
2020, the number of new cases reported outside
of mainland China (n = 459) exceeded the num-
ber reported from mainland China (n = 412) for
the first time and this trend has continued to
date (Figure 4). The total number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases reported by 134 countries, ter-
ritories and areas outside of mainland China in
the current reporting week has increased almost
threefold (n = 61,518) compared to the preced-
ing week (n = 21,110).1,3
Italy reported 29% (n =
17,660) of all cases outside of mainland China;
the Islamic Republic of Iran reported 18% (n =
11,364); the Republic of Korea reported 13% (n =
8,086) and Spain reported 7% (n = 4,231). Thirty-
eight countries, territories and areas reported
cases of COVID-19 for the first time in the past
seven days. Of all the countries, territories and
areas outside of mainland China with known
transmission classification (n = 134), fifty-eight
percent (n = 78) have reported local transmis-
sion of COVID-19.
Globally, 5,393 deaths have been reported, with
57% (n = 3,075) reported from Hubei Province,
China and 119 deaths reported from elsewhere
within mainland China. The remaining 2,199
deaths were reported by 35 countries, territories
and areas outside of mainland China.1
The current estimates on epidemiological param-
eters including severity, transmissibility and
incubation period are uncertain. Estimates are
likely to change as more information becomes
available.
Country in focus: Italy
Data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
Italy have not been made publicly available.
The following is therefore a brief summary
based on information obtained from WHO
situation reports and the Italian Ministry of
Health.
Italy reported its first two confirmed cases
of COVID-19 on 31 January 2020.4
Cases
increased rapidly with 6 new cases reported
on 22 February 2020 up to 17,660 cases on
14 March 2020. Reported deaths increased
more than sixfold (n = 197) on 7 March to
1268 on 14 March 2020.1,2
Among the cases
reported as at 14 March 2020, 51% (n =
9,059) were reported in Lombardia, 13% (n
= 2,349) in Emilia Romagna and 10% (n =
1,775) in Veneto.5
Italy is now the epicentre
outside of mainland China with the most
rapid growth of COVID-19 cases, surpass-
ing the Republic of Korea and the Islamic
Republic of Iran (Figure 5).
Based on confirmed cases up to 14 March
2020, the case fatality rate (CFR) for Italy
has been calculated at 7.8%. As the out-
break continues, the confirmed CFR may
change. The current calculated CFR does
not include the number of cases with mild
infections that may be missed from current
surveillance, nor does it account for the
recently confirmed cases that may subse-
quently develop severe disease and die.
On 9 March 2020, Italy became the first
European country to place a nationwide
travel ban from all travel unless certi-
fied as justified on professional or health
grounds.6
The nationwide restrictions will
be in effect until 3 April 2020. On 11 March
2020, the Italian Prime Minister imposed
new restrictions by closing non-essential
commercial activities in the country, with
the exception of basic necessities and phar-
macies. The new restrictions will be valid
for two weeks.7

Transmission
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2
is via droplets and fomites from an infected per-
son to a close contact.8
A study of cases and their
close contacts in China supports this. Household
contacts and those who travelled with a con-
firmed COVID-19 case were strongly associated
with an increased risk of infection.9
The study
also examined the average time from symptom
onset to disease confirmation among cases who
were identified through symptom-based surveil-
lance (i.e. symptomatic screening at airports,
community fever monitoring and testing of hos-
pital patients) and contact-based surveillance
(i.e. monitoring and testing of close contacts of
confirmed COVID-19 cases). Compared to cases
identified through symptom-based surveillance,
cases identified through contact-based surveil-
lance were associated with a 2.3 day decrease
from symptom onset to disease confirmation,
and a 1.9 day decrease from symptom onset to
isolation. Based on modelling, researchers have
found that effective contact tracing increases the
probability of control.9
A virological analysis
of nine hospitalised cases found proof of active
virus replication in upper respiratory tract tis-
sues, with pharyngeal virus shedding very high
during the first week of symptoms.10
COVID-19
can often present as a common cold-like illness
where the virus is shed for a prolonged time after
symptoms end, including in stools.10
This may
have implications for current case definitions
and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak
containment.10
Current evidence does not support airborne or
faecal-oral spread as major factors in transmis-
sion.8
Incubation period
Estimates of median incubation period, based
on seven published studies, are 5 to 6 days
(ranging from 0 to 14 days).11
Patients with long
incubation periods do occasionally occur and
have been reported, however medical experts
have described these patients as ‘outliers’ who
should be studied further and do not represent
a significant shift in thinking about the virus.11
Clinical features
Ongoing evidence, including a recently pub-
lished meta-analysis, supports previous research
that COVID-19 presents as mild illness in the
majority of cases with fever and cough being
the most commonly reported symptoms. Severe
or fatal outcomes tend to occur in the elderly
or those with comorbid conditions.8,12
Some
COVID-19 patients show neurological signs
such as headache, nausea and vomiting. A study
identified increasing evidence that coronavi-
ruses are not always confined to the respiratory
tract and may also invade the central nervous
system inducing neurological symptoms.13
As
such, it is likely that the potential invasion of
SARS-CoV2 to the central nervous system is
partially responsible for the acute respiratory
failure of COVID-19 patients.13
Examination of
cases and their close contacts in China found a
positive association between age and time from
symptom onset to recovery. Median time to
recovery was estimated to be 27 days in 20–29
year olds, 32 days in 50–59 year olds, and 36
days in those aged over 70 years. The study also
found an association between clinical sever-
ity and time from symptom onset to time to
recovery. Compared to people with mild disease,
those with moderate and severe disease were
associated with a 19% and 58% increase in time
to recovery, respectively.9
A retrospective cohort
study looking at risk factors for mortality among
patients with COVID-19 who have experienced
a definite outcome found an increase in the odds
of in-hospital death associated with older age,
higher sequential organ failure assessment score
and elevated blood d-dimer levels on admis-
sion.14
Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted
for a median of 20 days in survivors and sus-
tained until death in non-survivors.14
Molecular epidemiology
Based on modelling, researchers estimated that
initial human SARS-CoV-2 infection was in

November to early December 2019.15
An analysis
based on 86 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2,
obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing
All Influenza Data (GISAID), found many muta-
tions.16
This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 will con-
tinue to evolve as the outbreak occurs. Ongoing
surveillance of sequences and shared mutations
will assist with understanding the spread of the
virus globally and within Australia.
Treatment
Current clinical management of COVID-19
cases focuses on early recognition, isolation,
appropriate infection control measures and
provision of supportive care.17
Whilst there is
no specific antiviral treatment currently recom-
mendedforpatientswithsuspectedorconfirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, multiple clinical trials
are underway to evaluate a number of thera-
peutic agents, including remdesivir, lopinavir/
ritonavir, and chloroquine.18
Comparison between COVID-19, SARS
and MERS
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can
cause upper respiratory tract infections in
humans. Coronaviruses can occasionally cause
severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and more recently COVID-19.
Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-
CoV-2 is thought to have originated from bats,
and to have been transmitted to humans via an
intermediate animal host. The intermediate ani-
mal host responsible for COVID-19 is currently
unknown.19
Table 4 provides an overview of
characteristics of COVID-19, MERS and SARS.
Public health response
The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on
CoronavirusDisease2019(COVID-19)describes
some of the key aspects associated with the
evolving outbreak in mainland China, includ-
ing transmission dynamics, disease progression
and severity, mainland China’s response and
knowledge gaps. As part of the report, the fol-
lowing major recommendations were made for
countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks
of COVID-19:8
1.Immediately activate the highest level of
national Response Management protocols to
ensure the all-of-government and all-of-so-
ciety approach needed to contain COVID-19
with non-pharmaceutical public health
measures;
2.Prioritise active, exhaustive case finding and
immediate testing and isolation, painstaking
contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of
close contacts;
3.Fully educate the general public on the
seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in
preventing its spread;
4.Immediately expand surveillance to detect
COVID-19 transmission chains, by test-
ing all patients with atypical pneumonias,
conducting screening in some patients with
upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent
COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for
the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance
systems (e.g. systems for influenza-like-
illness); and
5.Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and
simulations for the deployment of even more
stringent measures to interrupt transmis-
sion chains as needed (e.g. the suspension
of large-scale gatherings and the closure of
schools and workplaces).

Background
On 31 December 2019, the World Health
Organization (WHO) was notified about a large
number of cases of pneumonia of unknown
origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
Chinese authorities isolated and identified a
novel coronavirus on 7 January 2020.23
WHO
declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.8
From 1 February 2020, Australia denied entry to
anyone who had left or transited through main-
land China, with the exception of Australian
citizens, permanent residents and their imme-
diate family and air crew who have been using
appropriate personal protective equipment
(Figure 4).24
The Australian Health Protection
Principal Committee (AHPPC) have reviewed
these restrictions weekly, and on 4 March 2020,
they released a statement recommending cur-
rent travel restrictions for mainland China and
the Islamic Republic of Iran remain in place for
a further seven days.25
On 5 March 2020, the
Prime Minister announced new travel restric-
tions for travellers coming from the Republic of
Korea, and implementation of enhanced health
screening for arrivals from Italy. From 5 March
2020, foreign nationals (excluding permanent
residents of Australia) will be prevented from
coming to Australia until 14 days after leav-
ing the Republic of Korea.26
On 8 March 2020,
AHPPC recommended that people who have
been a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19
case, or who returned from or transited through
a listed higher risk country*, must not attend
public gatherings until 14 days after leaving the
country or having contact with a confirmed
case even if they are completely symptom free.27
Those undergoing COVID-19 testing also must
not attend public gatherings until they have
received their result.27
On March 11, AHPPC
recommended that the government continue to
direct primary focus toward domestic contain-
ment and preparedness of COVID-19, and that
enhanced border measures and travel restric-
tions be maintained for a further 7 days.28
On
March 12, AHPPC provided recommendations
on testing and work restriction for health and
aged care workers. In addition to the other sus-
pect case criteria, AHPPC recommended testing
for any health care worker (HCW) who provides
directcareANDwhohasafever(>37.5°C)AND
an acute respiratory infection (e.g. shortness of
breath, cough, coryza, and/or sore throat), are
classified as a suspect case and should be tested
for COVID-19. Recommendations for exclusion
from work for HCW were also provided.29
On 13
March, AHPPC provided recommendations for
public gatherings and testing by putting in place
social distancing measures to mitigate spread.30
This includes:
• Limiting non-essential organised gatherings
to fewer than 500 people;
• Limiting non-essential meetings or confer-
ences of critical workforce e.g. healthcare
professionals and emergency services;
• Encouraging all Australians to exercise
personal responsibility for social distancing
measures; and
• Initiating measures to protect vulnerable
populations, such as reducing visitors to all
residential care facilities and remote Aborigi-
nal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
AHPPC acknowledges that diagnostic testing
issues are related to an emerging global short-
age and are reviewing the case definition. The
current situation emphasises the need for testing
to be limited to the current recommendations.30
AHPPC acknowledged that Australia’s border
measures may no longer be able to prevent the
importation of COVID-19, and the primary
focus should now be directed at domestic con-
tainment and preparedness.24
Local transmis-
sion of COVID-19 has occurred in Australia,
highlighting the need of effective containment
measures to limit spread. Early isolation of iden-
tified cases and quarantine of suspected cases
and close contacts is a key measure to minimise
transmission of COVID-19 in the community.

Version
Date of
development
Suspect Case Confirmed Case
1.18 13 March 2020 A. If the patient satisfies epidemiological and clinical
criteria, they are classified as a suspect case.
Epidemiological criteria
• International travel in the 14 days before illness onset.
OR
• Close contact in 14 days before illness onset with a
confirmed case of COVID-19.
Clinical criteria
• Fever
OR
• Acute respiratory infection (e.g. shortness of breath,
cough, sore throat) with or without fever.
B. If the patient has severe community-acquired
pneumonia (critically ill) and no other cause is identified,
with or without recent international travel, they are
classified as a suspect case.
C. If any healthcare worker with direct patient contact
has a fever (≥ 37.5°C) AND an acute respiratory infection
(e.g. shortness of breath, cough, sore throat), they are
classified as a suspect case.
A person who
tests positive to a
validated specific
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic
acid test or has the
virus identified by
electron microscopy
or viral culture.
However, as COVID-19 presents as mild illness
in the majority of cases, early identification and
isolation of cases may be difficult to achieve.
Methods
Data for this report were current as at 19:00
hours AEDT, 14 March 2020.
This report outlines what is known epidemio-
logically on COVID-19 in Australia and from
publicly available data from WHO Situation
Reports, other countries’ official updates and
the scientific literature. Data on domestic cases
in this report were collected from the National
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
(NNDSS) and jurisdictional health department
media releases. The Communicable Diseases
Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case
definition for suspect and confirmed cases,
which was modified at different time points
during the outbreak (Table 5). Data were ana-
lysed using Stata to describe the epidemiology of
COVID-19 in Australia and the progress of the
epidemic.
Data for the international cases of COVID-19
by country were compiled from the latest WHO
Situation Report. Case definitions may vary by
country making comparisons difficult. Rapid
reviews of the current state of knowledge on
COVID-19 were conducted from the literature
using PubMed.
