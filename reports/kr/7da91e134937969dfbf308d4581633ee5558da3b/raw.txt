□ The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released youth

immunization coverage data from 2017, showing a 96.6% coverage rate in
infants born in 2016 (12 months old), 94.1% in toddlers born in 2015 (24 months
old), and 90.4% in those born in 2014 (36 months old).

○ The data show a 0.4 to 1.4%p increase in immunization rates per age group compared

to the previous year. Similar to last year, lower coverage rates among older age groups
were due to the increasing number of required vaccinations with age.

□

South Korea’s youth immunization coverage is 2~9%p higher than
that of other developed countries*, including the United States of
America, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
* Immunization rates per vaccine (average of five vaccines): ROK 96.9%, USA 87.8%, AUS 95.1%, UK 94.0%

□ The report used the immunization history data of 1,290,000 infants and

toddlers born throughout the country from 2014 to 2016 as recorded in
the national immunization management system as of June 30th, 2018.
Similar reports have been released annually since 2015.

facilities that offer these vaccines can be found on the National
Immunization Program website or b y using the NI P smartphone
