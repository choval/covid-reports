□ KCDC Central IMS Interim Report on MERS Response
○ (Confirmed Case) The confirmed case (confirmed on Sept. 8) is currently being
treated in a negative pressure isolation ward at Seoul National University
Hospital and is in stable condition.

○ (Close Contacts) All 21 close contacts tested negative for MERS on Sept.
13, which marked the average incubation period (6 days) following
suspected contact.
- This first test was conducted as part of the monitoring process to provide
psychological support to close contacts concerned about their infection
status. A second test will be conducted on Sept. 20, two days prior to the
end of the incubation period. These contacts will be released from isolation
if the second test results return negative.
* Second test on Sept. 20 → Results analyzed on Sept. 21; if results return negative
→ Released from isolation on Sept. 22, 00:00
○ All 11 contacts of the confirmed case who were classified as suspected
cases tested negative for MERS.
* 11 Suspected cases : 1 close contact, 10 casual contacts
○ (Epidemiological Investigation) KCDC worked closely with the Seoul Metropolitan
Government in conducting epidemiological investigation to identify possible
routes of infection and to conduct contact tracing through direct questioning,
CCTV analysis, airline passenger information, and card transaction histories.
- A team of 2 KCDC staff and one expert from the private sector was

condition

of

the

confirmed

patient,

KCDC

determined that the risk of further spread of MERS is low. Regardless,
prevention and control efforts will be maintained until the end of the
incubation period.
- The confirmed case is being treated in a negative pressure isolated ward
and is in stable condition. Healthcare workers are protected from any
exposure.
- While being transported to the hospital, the confirmed case only had contact
with a limited number of individuals, and first test results for all close
contacts returned negative. All 11 suspected cases were also tested
negative for MERS.
* (2015 MERS Outbreak) The majority of infections (92.5%) occurred in
hospital settings (patient wards, emergency rooms) from patients with
respiratory symptoms who infected others
□ In response to the confirmed case on Sept. 8, central and local government
agencies initiated collaborative measures to prevent the additional spread of
MERS.
○ (Response Measures) On Sept. 8, KCDC raised the infectious disease alert level from
BLUE to YELLOW and established a Central IMS.
- KCDC and the Ministry of the Interior and Safety (MOIS) established the MERS
Management System (Sept. 8), the MERS Response Team (Sept. 9), and
collaborative efforts with the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA), and the local governments of all 17 provinces to prevent the additional
spread of MERS.
* The Prime Minister held a meeting on Sept. 9 to call for active
collaboration across relevant government sectors
- The Infectious Disease Risk Management Committee meeting (Sept. 11 and
14), a meeting of MERS experts (Sept. 11 and 14), and a MERS response
meeting for healthcare professionals (Sept. 10, with the Korean Medical
Association, Korean Hospital Association, Korean Nurses Association, Korean
Pharmaceutical

Association)

were

held

among

infectious

disease

and

epidemiology experts to discuss infectious disease prevention, control, and
response measures and to strengthen collaborative efforts between the public
and private sectors.
- KCDC is collaborating with WHO to share contact information and updates
on domestic response measures with Kuwait and other countries to prevent
and control further spread of MERS at the international level.
○ (Contacts Isolation) As of Sept. 13, KCDC, MOIS, and local governments are
jointly conducting daily monitoring of 21 close contacts and 427 casual contacts.
- Close contacts are isolated either at home or at designated facilities and are
undergoing active surveillance. Representatives from local public health
centers are assigned 1:1 to isolated close contacts and contact them twice
a day (morning and night) by phone throughout the incubation period (14
days) to check for any MERS-like symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of
breath, etc.).
- Casual contacts are undergoing active monitoring. Representatives from local
governments contact them once a day by phone throughout the incubation
period (14 days) to check for any MERS-like symptoms (fever, cough,
shortness of breath, etc.)
- If contacts meet the conditions of suspected MERS-like symptoms, they are
transferred to nationally designated negative pressure isolation beds and
undergo testing, if necessary.
○ (Medical Resources) 196 nationally designated negative pressure isolation beds
(158 wards) in 28 hospitals around the country are currently being operated
for isolated treatment of additional cases, if necessary.
- Personal protective equipment (PPE; protective clothing sets, N95 masks,
etc.) has been provided to local governments, healthcare facilities, and other
relevant agencies as part of measures to prevent additional spread of
MERS.
○ (Quarantine Management) Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 0404 Call
Center, travelers to the Middle East receive text messages with information
on preventing MERS infection.
- Upon arriving in ROK after visiting the Middle East, travelers submit their
completed health questionnaires and undergo 1:1 internal body temperature
checks.
- 4 -

- For early detection of suspected MERS cases, travelers entering from the
Middle East receive text messages (4 times) through the Quarantine
Information System after arriving, advising them to report any suspected
symptoms should they occur during the incubation period. Also, the travel
histories of recent travelers to the Middle East are shared* with healthcare
facilities for accurate diagnosis.
* Travel information is provided using the Health Insurance Review & Assessment
Service Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and the International Traveler Information
System (ITS)
□ KCDC is collaborating closely with local government agencies in contact tracing
and management to prevent the additional spread of MERS.
○ KCDC would like to express its appreciation to the close and casual contacts
of the confirmed case for their active cooperation. During the remaining
duration of the incubation period, contacts are asked to continue
cooperating with monitoring procedures. Individuals who experience any
MERS-like symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) are advised not to
visit hospitals directly*; instead, they should report their symptoms to the
KCDC 1339 Call Center or their local public health center and follow their
instructions.
* There is a risk of infecting other individuals by visiting hospitals and
emergency rooms.
○ Healthcare providers are advised to check the travel history of incoming
patients with respiratory symptoms to see if they have recently traveled to
the Middle East. The travel history of Korean nationals can be checked
through the Drug Usage Review (DUR) system, while that of foreign
nationals can be checked through direct questioning. Healthcare providers
should report any patients suspected of MERS-CoV infection to local public
health centers or call the KCDC Call Center at 1339.
○ When visiting the Middle East, individuals are advised to maintain proper
personal hygiene, such as washing hands frequently, and to avoid visits to
local farms, contact with camels, consumption of raw camel meat or camel
milk, and unnecessary visits to local medical facilities.

- 5 -

- Individuals are asked to cooperate with quarantine procedures, such as
honestly completing health status questionnaires at the time of entry.
* (2018 MERS Cases) 114 cases in Saudi Arabia (30 deaths), 1 in Oman, 1
in UAE (as of Sept. 8)
* (Domestic Suspected Case Reports) 200 cases in 2016, 220 in 2017, 205 in 2018
(as of Sept. 13)

* Additional information on the current situation will be provided upon further
epidemiological investigation to ensure rapid, accurate, and transparent
communication with the public.
