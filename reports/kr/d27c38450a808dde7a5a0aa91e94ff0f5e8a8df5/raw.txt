□ In order to strengthen control efforts and prevent the spread of MERS, KCDC is
working closely with the ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Embassy of Saudi
Arabia in Seoul, and travel agencies involved in Hajj travel planning. Together,
they are providing important information to those traveling to the Middle East and
strengthening quarantine measures for those returning from the Middle East.
□ Due to the ongoing cases of MERS in the Middle East, KCDC advises travelers to the
region to avoid visiting hospitals and other medical facilities unless necessary. When
visiting such facilities, KCDC urges the use of masks to prevent the spread of MERS.
○ When visiting the Middle East, travelers are advised to avoid contact with camels, which
have been indicated as a source of primary infection, and camel products, including the
consumption of camel meat and milk, and are also advised to practice proper hand hygiene.
○ Travelers who experience any fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms within 14
days upon returning to Korea should refrain from visiting hospitals and are advised to
contact the KCDC 1339 Call Center or visit a local public health center for further instructions.
