○ Based on recent situations in relation to COVID-19 outbreak and response and discussions in Central
Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters presided by the Prime Minister, the Korean Government
has decided that Korea will transition into “Distancing in Daily Life” policy/campaign on 6 May.
○ Noting that COVID-19 outbreak is not likely to end within a short period of time and is expected to
prolong globally, KCDC asked the public to follow the “5 Everyday Infection Prevention Rules for
Everyone” with a sense of responsibility.
- (1) Stay home for 3-4 days if you’re sick.
- (2) Keep a distance of two arms’ length between you and other people.
- (3) Wash your hands for 30 seconds. Cough/sneeze into your sleeve.
- (4) Ventilate your space at least twice a day. Disinfect regularly.
- (5) Keep in touch with family and friends even during physical distancing.
○ KCDC also provided 4 supplementary guidance for daily infection prevention. (Summary below)
- (1) Mask wearing (Proper mask wearing practices/methods)
- (2) Disinfection (How to disinfect homes/offices)
- (3) Guidance for the elderly and high-risk population (What to do when leaving home or under stress)
- (4) Healthy lifestyle habits (Regular exercise, regular health checkup, balanced diet, mental health)

○ Since facemasks are effective at helping to prevent viral transmission through respiratory droplets,
Korea has decided to recommend mask wearing for everyone in any of the following situations:
- People with respiratory symptoms
- Caring for COVID-19 suspected patients
- Visiting hospitals, clinics, pharmacy, or care facilities for the elderly or disabled
- People whose work environment puts them come in contact with many people
- Using public transit or other indoor spaces that are not well-ventilated and used by many people with
possibility of close contact
- Using indoor publicly used venues
- Outdoor environment where it is difficult to keep 2-meter distance from other people
○ KCDC stressed that the new “Distancing in Daily Life” policy should not be interpreted as signaling a
return to life before the pandemic but rather as entering a “new normal” in which infection prevention
practices become a part of everyday life including social and economic activities for everyone.
- KCDC also noted the possibility that a return to Enhanced Social Distancing may be required if
situation becomes worse in the future.
- KCDC urged everyone to work together to keep COVID-19 away by practicing distancing measures in
their everyday life.
