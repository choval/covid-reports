○ KCDC noted that many children and teens are experiencing depression, anxiety, and fear due to
COVID-19 and that the outbreak can be a source of stress for young people as evidenced by increases in
related counselling sessions. KCDC urged parents and guardians to clearly communicate accurate
information and preventive measures to children in a way that’s easy to understand to help ease anxiety
and fear.
- In a recent survey that asked 42 seven-year-olds “What do you think of COVID-19?”, 69% responded
“It’s scary”.
- In another survey of asked 889 middle and high school students, respondents reported feeling
suffocated (44.1%), frustrated/irritated (22.4%), emotionless (10.9%), and scared (9.0%).
- A study of over 1,800 elementary school students in Hubei Province, China has found that 1 out of 5
have experienced symptoms of depression or anxiety or both.
○ KCDC explained that in order to protect our children during this COVID-19 outbreak, adults need to
be thoughtful and understanding of children at home and at school and try to ensure psychological
stability of children.
- KCDC stressed the need to explain to children preventive measures and plans regarding COVID-19 in a
way they can understand and that COVID-19 can be prevented by following guidelines such as washing
hands carefully and wearing masks.
- KCDC also asked adults to teach children not to blame or discriminate or harbor prejudice against
other children who have been infected with COVID-19 and explained that words of encouragement and
positivity and hope such as “You’re doing well!” “Let’s fight this together!” are important to relieving
children’s anxiety and improving their psychological stability.
○ In light of the upcoming long holiday weekend during which traveling and outdoor activities are
expected to increase, KCDC urged everyone to be extra careful.
- People who have fever or respiratory symptoms should not go on vacation trips. Any traveling if at all
should be done in small family units in personal vehicle. Crowded or popular destinations should be
avoided.
- During the trip, everyone should wash their hands frequently, cover up their nose and mouth with their
sleeve when sneezing/coughing, maintain distance of at least 2 meters from other people, and wear
facemasks if visiting indoor public venues.
- People who develop fever or respiratory symptoms while traveling should stay in their room and get
rest. People with prolonging fever or aggravating symptoms should call KCDC call center (1339 or area
code + 120) or contact a local public health center or visit a screening clinic to get tested early.
○ In light of the upcoming Children’s Day (5 May), KCDC and Ministry of Health and Welfare hosted a
children’s special briefing on COVID-19 today, taking questions from children on COVID-19 and providing
answers.
- The briefing was conducted as non-face-to-face briefing in observance of social distancing.
- Along with KCDC Director Dr Jung Eun-Kyeong, two pediatric physicians were invited as co-panelists to
explain COVID-19 prevention measures and latest children-related medical science.
