The interim classification is based on the reporting, which may change depending on further discussion with
the Central Clinical committee.

○ According to the epidemiological characteristics of death cases in Korea, it consists of 10 male(62.5%)
and 6 female (37.5%). By age group, 3 cases(18.6%) are in 70s, 6 cases (37.5%) are in 60s, and 5
cases in 50s. All the decreased cases are identified with having the underlying diseases. Especially, 7
Cheongdo Daenam hospital- related cases seemed to have affected the long-term hospitalization in a
mental ward, resulting in poor health. The cause of death will be confirmed based on death review
with the Central clinical committee.

○ KCDC asked to local government and health facilities to focus on test and treatment, especially for
those aged 65 and with underlying disease who needed early detection and treatment. Also, KCDC
stressed the monitoring of capacities on test, quarantines and treatment in case of the possibility of
community transmission.
○ In case of newly confirmed cases, the association with Shincheonji religious sect will be checked as the
priority. And KCDC recommends to carry out the initial epidemiological investigation and public health
measure thoroughly to minimize the community transmission which has no evidence to related
confirmed cases through chains of transmission.
○ KCDC recommends to civil people to keep the personal hygiene and practice ‘social distancing’ until
the beginning of March, an important point of this outbreak.
