the epidemiological investigation is on-going. All the other confirmed cases are in stable
condition.
○ The contacts of the confirmed cases are 1,318 in total, five of which were confirmed.
45 contacts of the 1st confirmed case were all released from monitoring on 3 February.
○ The newly developed diagnostic will be available at the 50 designated health
facilities from 7 February. The improved real-time PCR can detect the novel Coronavirus
within six hours. This diagnostic has been used at Municipal and Provincial Government
Public Health Institute of Health & Environment since 31 January.
○ With regard to the concerns on releasing whereabouts of the confirmed cases, KCDC
states that it is to inform the people who might have in contact with the confirmed
cases without notice so that they can monitor themselves for the onset of symptoms
and take appropriate measures as early as possible. Furthermore, KCDC emphasizes once
again that every place the confirmed cases visited has been disinfected, and they are
safe to visit after disinfection is complete.
