distance between people, require everyone to wear facemasks, and refrain from activities that may
cause respiratory droplets to travel such as choir, shouting, or chanting.
- People in high-risk groups (e.g. pregnant women, elderly aged 65 or older, people with chronic illness)
should especially stay away from visiting enclosed spaces with a lot of people.
- Nightlife entertainment venues are also recommended to refrain from operating as much as possible.
Such venues that remain operating must comply with infection prevention/control measures including
checking people for fever or respiratory symptoms and disinfecting/ventilating thoroughly.

place that are frequented by a lot of people. People who cannot avoid visiting such enclosed/crowded
places should keep at least 2 meters away from other people and keep their personal hygiene by
wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes, washing hands, and not touching their eyes/nose/mouth.
