*There was one deceased case in Busan, but the local government in charge of the case changed from Busan
to Gyeongbuk.
○ 79.7% of the total cases have epidemiological links and 20.3% are either under investigation or
individual cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each region or city are shown in the
Table 1 next page.
○ In Daegu and Gyeongbuk region, the transmission seems a bit slow down as testing Shincheonji
members is almost finished. However, since the confirmed cases continue to be reported from health
facilities and community centers, the local governments are taking response measures to prevent further
transmission at such facilities. In Seoul and Gyeonggi region as well, small-scale, sporadic outbreaks have
been identified mainly at the places where high-risk groups visit often, such as health facilities and
community centers. It is critical to strengthen the surveillance at these facilities.
○ Seven pregnant women have recently been confirmed of COVID-19. There is not much information
about COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, but considering the main mode of transmission, droplet and
contact, vertical transmission through blood or giving birth is unlikely.
○ At this moment, it is required to take both measures, control of local transmission and prevention of
additional importation, taking into account the current global situation.
- There have been 101 thousand confirmed cases with 3,700 deceased in 96 countries except Republic of
Korea. According to WHO, 53 countries have local community transmission. Although transmission in China
seems decreasing, there is a surge in other countries, such as Italy and Iran. Furthermore, more than 200
cases have been confirmed in the Unites States and Japan respectively. The situation and transmission
trends in these countries are closely monitored. Central Disease Control Headquarters will share the
monitoring results with the public in a timely manner and consider strengthening the quarantine inspection
on travellers from the countries with local transmission.
