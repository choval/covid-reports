◇ Citrobacter freundii with the same genetic sequence was confirmed
in TPN injections administered to the deceased infants
- The injections are suspected to have been contaminated during
their preparation, and further investigations are underway with
the police to confirm the source

□ A report on December 18th explained that antibiotic resistant Citrobacter freundii
was found in blood cultures taken from the three infants prior to their deaths,
and their genetic sequence was found to be identical on the 19th. Subsequently,
on the 26th, KCDC announced that the same bacteria were confirmed in the
administered total parenteral nutrition (TPN)* injections.
* Administered to those who have trouble eating to provide necessary nutrients
□ The injections were administered using a central venous line*, suggesting the
possibility that they had been contaminated in their preparation. Although infection
has not been confirmed as the cause of death**, collaboration with the police
is underway to find the source of contamination.
* A central venous catheter is a catheter used to administer medication or
fluids unable to be taken by mouth
** Five out of 16 infants received the injections, resulting in four deaths

□ The 12 other infants showed no suspected symptoms, and their blood and stool
cultures showed no signs of the bacteria. Rotavirus was confirmed in environmental
samples (incubator, blankets, etc.) from the NICU and samples from nine of the
12 infants. Eight of the nine viruses had the same genetic sequence (one pending).
KCDC is closely monitoring the condition of the infants.
