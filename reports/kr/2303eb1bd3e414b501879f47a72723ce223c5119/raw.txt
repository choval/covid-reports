* Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 80.9% of the total cases; 9.6% are either under investigation
or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in
Table 3.
○ In Pohang, Gyeongbuk Province, one person tested positive from testing conducted for entry to
Marine Corps Education and Training Group. Infection prevention/control measures and epidemiological
investigation are underway.
○ KCDC released interim analysis of epidemiological investigation on cases linked to Uijeongbu St. Mary’s
Hospital in Gyeonggi Province.
- From 30 March to 21 April, 57 cases within the hospital (patients = 26; nurses = 3; physicians = 2;
janitors = 2; caregivers = 10; family/guardians = 14) and 15 cases from local transmission to
communities (family = 6; Hantan River Spa Hotel = 7; Asan Medical Center = 2) were confirmed.
- According to the epidemiological investigation, there was a patient who started showing symptoms
before symptom onset (26 March) of the index case of this cluster. Also, one person who had been
discharged from inpatient care at this hospital was confirmed on 20 March. Therefore, it is presumed
that transmission occurred in the hospital before 20 March. The infection source has not been
identified.

- Some confirmed cases are not from the 8th floor where the index case was receiving inpatient care.
Therefore, it is presumed that transmission between different floors occurred by movement of
healthcare workers, caregivers, and/or patients.
- Once the cluster outbreak was identified, central and local governments worked together for response.
58 additional cases were found through their efforts at tracking discharged patients, family/guardians,
and caregivers no longer working at the hospital and contact monitoring.
- By testing all contacts, 22 (30.6%) asymptomatic infected persons were identified early. No secondary
transmission from asymptomatic case occurred.
○ Stressing that COVID-19 outbreak is still ongoing even though the number of new confirmed cases
has been small lately, KCDC asked people to actively cooperate in Social Distancing and asked people to
be careful this weekend regarding religious facilities and nightlife facilities.
- KCDC recommends people to participate in religious functions via non-face-to-face methods such as
online worship/meetings. Religious facilities that host on-site events must check people for fever, keep
distance between people, require everyone to wear facemasks, and refrain from activities that may
cause respiratory droplets to travel such as choir, shouting, or chanting.
- People in high-risk groups (e.g. pregnant women, elderly aged 65 or older, people with chronic illness)
should especially stay away from visiting enclosed spaces with a lot of people.
- Nightlife entertainment venues are also recommended to refrain from operating as much as possible.
Such venues that remain operating must comply with infection prevention/control measures including
checking people for fever or respiratory symptoms and disinfecting/ventilating thoroughly.
- People are recommended to refrain from visiting any enclosed space with poor ventilation or any place
that are frequented by a lot of people. People who cannot avoid visiting such enclosed/crowded places
should keep at least 2 meters away from other people, wear a facemask, refrain from handshakes, wash
hands, and refrain from touching eyes/nose/mouth.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or
leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
- KCDC also urged people to get tested early if more than 2-3 people at work or family unit develop
COVID-19 suspected symptoms such as fever or coughing.
