○ Epidemiological links have been found for 80.2% of the total cases; 19.8% are either under
investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are
shown in Table 4.

○ Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 5.

○ A

graph of imported cases by period and region of origin is provided in Figure 1.

○ A current total of 55 confirmed cases have been reported from a church (Grace River Church) in
Gyeonggi Province since 9 March. Further investigation and contact tracing are underway.
○ A current total of 31 confirmed cases have been reported from a healthcare facility (Bundang Jesaeng
Hospital) in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province since 5 March. Further investigation and contact tracing are
underway
○ In Daegu, testing is being conducted for every person at high-risk facilities such as nursing homes. A
current total of 74 confirmed cases (57 patients, 17 staff) have been reported from Hansarang
Convalescent Hospital in Seo-gu, Daegu City, and 13 other confirmed cases have been reported from
other nursing homes in the city. Further epidemiological investigation and control measures are underway.
○ In light of the recent rapid rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Europe, the U.S., and the Middle
East region, as well as the rise in the number of imported cases both from airport quarantine and in
communities, the KCDC announced that the Special Entry Procedure will be extended to all travelers
arriving at port beginning at 0:00 of 19 March. Upon entering Korea, all travelers will be required to

respond to a questionnaire, get

checked for fever, provide a domestic address and confirmed contact

information at port entry, and report their symptoms daily for the next 14 days via the self health check
mobile app (“Self-Diagnosis”) on their mobile device. Travel histories of all travelers entering Korea will be
provided to healthcare providers via the International Traveler Information System for reference. The
names of all entrants will be provided to local public health centers for a more active monitoring of
potential imported cases for the first 14 days upon their arrival.
○ The KCDC strongly recommended canceling or delaying of all international travel on non-urgent
matters. Persons who are unable to avoid traveling out of the country for a critical reason are advised to
refrain from visiting any closed facilities or healthcare facilities, and voluntarily disclose any symptoms and
their international travel history upon returning to Korea and follow appropriate guidelines and
instructions.
○ In light of the continued emergence of outbreaks in health facilities and church clusters, the KCDC
stressed the importance of strengthening prevention management for such community facilities. The KCDC
urged people to refrain from attending crowded places or religious gatherings and recommended that
workplaces actively encourage and enable employees to work remotely from home.
○ The KCDC again reminded everyone that personal hygiene and social distancing practices are effective
measures to prevent infections. Any person who suspect onset COVID-19 symptoms are advised to call
the KCDC call center (1339) or local call centers (area code + 120), ask a local public health center, or
visit a screening facility, before visiting a regular healthcare provider directly. All persons who visit a
screening center should wear a mask and drive their own car if possible.
