- A survey of 1,000 people conducted by a team from Seoul National University highlighted that 65.6%
of the response said ‘yes’ to a question of; “The risk of infection will increase to my family and I if
we go back to our everyday routine such as going to work or school after termination of enhanced
social distancing measures” (‘No’ was 10.4%).
- On the other hand, 72.1% said ‘yes’ to a question asking their willingness to accept the ‘new normal
life’ which is embracing social distancing in daily lives.
- When they were asked about areas to improve in order to create an environment that incorporates
routine life and social distancing, 32.9% answered; “cultivating social norm and culture that promotes
social distancing as part of our everyday routine” was important. In addition, 24.9% also stated the
systematic provision which allows people to “stay at home when they are sick“ was important .
○ KCDC stated that although the number of confirmed cases are recently declining, this is due to social
distancing efforts up to previous week. Therefore KCDC is keeping a close eye on possible cases that
may occur in the upcoming week due to the recent events such as general election and Easter Sunday
celebration.
○ KCDC stressed that since there are still unknown sporadic cases in the community and pandemic is
ongoing overseas, we still need to be on guard.
○ KCDC urged everyone to continue to follow social distancing and personal hygiene guidelines since
COVID-19 can spread rapidly through close contacts, especially indoors, without being aware of the
infection.
- KCDC stressed that the most important and effective measures against COVID-19 are to reduce contacts
with other people as much as possible, wash hands thoroughly, and go to a screening clinic to get
tested if any suspected symptoms occur.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance
from others, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.
- KCDC urged young people to avoid enclosed spaces such as nightclubs, bars, and cafes and to refrain
from social gatherings that may involve close contacts with other people.
Call to actions for all citizens
① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel plans.
* There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and events involving
sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do not go to
work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
③ Stay home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to work.
④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from each other.
⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal hygiene.
⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.
