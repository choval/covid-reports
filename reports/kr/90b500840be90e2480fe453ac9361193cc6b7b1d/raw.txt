○ The Korean government has raised the alert level from Orange(Level 3) to Red (Level 4) in order to
prepare for a possible nation-wide transmission. It was a proactive decision taking into consideration the
pattern and speed of transmission.
- Community transmission has been expanded from special management regions, Daegu (Shincheonji)
and Cheongdo (Daenam Hospital). The newly confirmed cases are also mostly related to Shincheonji
clusters.
- The government takes both containment and mitigation strategies, considering the different situations
in regions. In the special management regions (Daegu and Cheongdo), the response measures are more
focused on isolating and treating potential cases than tracing an individual case. Furthermore, medical
resources are put into severe cases so as to mitigate the impact, such as death. In other regions,
epidemiological investigation and environmental disinfection are conducted to find Shincheonji-related
cases as well as to prevent sporadic community spread.
