○ Two confirmed cases(#7, #22) were tested negative twice in a row and will be
discharged today. Nine of the confirmed cases have been discharged so far.
○ KCDC also provided the updates on the Korean nationals evacuated from Wuhan.
The first group returned on 15 February were 368 people in total, 2 of which have
already been confirmed positive of COVID-19. The second group returned on 1
February were 333 people in total and have been confirmed positive of COVID-19.
They will be released as well on 16 February.
○ KCDC pointed out that we must prepare for the community transmission and
spreading in health care setting, even though no further confirmed cases have been
confirmed in recent days.
○ Community transmission is on-going in China and the cases without a clear
epidemiological link are being reported in Singapore and Japan. Therefore, it is
possible to have the risk of community spread even in mild symptoms, and the
infection may spread among patient and older people in health case setting.
