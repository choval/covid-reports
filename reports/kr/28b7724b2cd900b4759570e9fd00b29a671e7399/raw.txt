○ KCDC released interim analysis of the 1,006 imported cases as of 0:00 of 20 April.
- Imported cases contributed 9.4% of total 10,674 confirmed cases.
- First imported case was a patient from China on 20 January. Imported cases surged in March. China
and other Asian countries made up a large proportion in the beginning, then Europe in March, and
Americas in April.
- Importation was highest during 22 March – 4 April; 61.7% (621 cases) of all imported cases occurred
during this 14-day period.
- In terms of location, 418 (41.6%) cases were confirmed at entry screening; 244 (24.3%) in Seoul; 151
(15.0%) in Gyeonggi Province; 41 (4.1%) in Incheon City.
- In terms of nationality, 922 (91.7%) were Korean nationals; 84 (8.3%) were foreign nationals.
- Of all imported cases, 61 have caused local transmission. In total, 157 cases were infected from
imported cases. Among the local transmissions caused by imported cases, 89 (54.4%) were family
members; 33 (20.6%) were friends or acquaintances; 27 (16.9%) were people at work; 8 (6.3%) were
infected from places visited by imported cases.
- With stronger entry screening and monitoring policy for inbound travelers that took effect since 1 April,
no imported case arriving on or after 1 April has caused local transmission as of date.
- Persons under home quarantine (self-quarantine) are required to comply with home quarantine
guidelines including not sharing personal items with or coming in contact with family, roommates, or
cohabitants.
- Family members, roommates, or cohabitants should also ensure that their personal items are kept
separate from the person under quarantine. They should clean all frequently touched surfaces often and
refrain from coming in contact with the person under quarantine as much as possible.
○ Following the end (19 April) of the previous Enhanced Social Distancing campaign, KCDC is leading a
slightly relaxed form of social distancing campaign until 5 May.
- High-risk facilities including nightlife entertainment venues, some fitness/sports venues, private
academies, and religious facilities are recommended to refrain from operation (previously “recommended
to suspend operation”). Facilities that remain in operation are required to comply with infection
prevention and control guidelines (same as before).
- People are recommended to refrain from non-essential social gatherings or events. Essential exams and
other unavoidable events will be allowed on a limited basis on the condition that infection
prevention/control guidelines are followed.
- National parks, recreation forests, arboreta and other relatively lower-risk “outdoor, dispersed” facilities
that have suspended operation may gradually reopen in phases on the condition that they implement
infection prevention/control policy measures. “Outdoor, concentrated” facilities that can meet the
“dispersion” requirement (e.g., professional baseball games held without any fans) will be allowed to
reopen on a limited basis.
○ KCDC stressed that the new Social Distancing policy/campaign (effective until 5 May) should not be
interpreted as return to normal life as before.
- KCDC recommended that any facility that makes it easy for people to come in close contact with other
people in an enclosed space should refrain from operating as much as possible. Such facilities that
have to remain in operation should comply with infection prevention/control guidelines including
checking all users for fever or respiratory symptoms, keeping a log of all users, requiring everyone to
wear facemasks and keep distance from each other, and disinfecting and ventilating the space.
- KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible and maintaining personal
hygiene are highly important to preventing COVID-19.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance
from others, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or
leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
