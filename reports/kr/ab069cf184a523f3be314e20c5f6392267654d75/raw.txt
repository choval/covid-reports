○ Stressing that COVID-19 outbreak is still ongoing, KCDC asked people to actively cooperate in Social
Distancing especially during the upcoming holidays.
- Non-essential social gatherings, events, or travel plans should be refrained during Social Distancing
period.
- People who cannot avoid traveling should refrain from going on trips in large groups and instead
move in small family units. They should also refrain from visiting enclosed/crowded places where it is
easy to come in close contact with other people. They should keep 2 meters away from other people,
wear facemasks, wash hands thoroughly, and refrain from touching their eyes/nose/mouth.
- Nightlife entertainment venues are recommended to refrain from operating as much as possible. Such
venues that remain in operation must comply with infection prevention/control guidelines including
checking people for fever or respiratory symptoms, requiring everyone to wear facemasks, and
disinfecting/ventilating thoroughly.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or
leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
- In particular, people who develop COVID-19 suspected symptoms after coming in close contact with
other people in an enclosed space or along with more than 2-3 people at work or family unit also
showing COVID-19 suspected symptoms such as fever or coughing are advised to get tested early by
calling the call center (1339 or area code + 120) or visiting a screening center.
