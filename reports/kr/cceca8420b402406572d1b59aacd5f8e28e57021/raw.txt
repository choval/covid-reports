□ The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) received
the 2018 Korea Policy Award from the Korean Association for Policy Studies
(KIPS) for its Public Health Risk Communication Policy, which was developed
in response to the difficulties in communication experienced during the
2015 MERS outbreak.
○ Since its introduction in 2010, the Korea Policy Award has been presented
to institutes that have demonstrated leadership and action in the
development of outstanding policies.
○ The KCDC and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport were
joint recipients this year, and the award ceremony was held on Friday,
April 20th at the Korea Institute of Public Administration in Seoul.
□ With the introduction of the KCDC Public Health Risk Communication Policy,
a 24-hour communication channel was established to ensure rapid, accurate,
and transparent response measures among the government, public, media,
and medical institutions. The policy has been praised for its aim to minimize
adverse social impacts and public distress during times of emergency.
□ KCDC Director Jeong Eun-Kyeong expressed her gratitude to the KIPS for
acknowledging the successful efforts made over the past two years to improve
gaps in risk communication that were identified during the MERS outbreak,
emphasizing that problems in communication are directly linked to problems
in disease control and prevention.
○ Under KCDC’s core values of communication and trust, Director Jeong ensured that
continued efforts will be reflected in future policies to further promote public involvement
and strengthen capacities for infectious disease emergency prevention and response.
