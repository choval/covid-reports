* Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 80.9% of the total cases; 9.6% are either under investigation
or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in
Table 3.
○ From investigation of contacts linked to Busan Medical Center in Yeonje-gu, Busan City, 1 additional
case (a staff of Dongin High School in Dongnae-gu, Busan City) was confirmed. In total, 3 cases have
been confirmed since 18 April.
○ From Yecheon-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, 1 additional case was confirmed during contact investigation.
In total, 38 cases (including 3 in Andong and 1 in Mungyeong) have been confirmed since 9 April.
○ KCDC conducted analysis of 25 COVID-19 patients to find out if COVID-19 virus can be detected even
after patient recovery and antibody production.
- In all 25 patients, neutralizing antibodies were found.
- In 12 (48%) patients, even though the neutralizing antibodies were formed, their respiratory samples
tested positive for COVID-19 from PCR testing. Based on this finding, at the moment, KCDC presumes
that in some patients the viruses are not completely removed and some still remains in patient’s body
even after neutralizing antibodies are produced.

○ KCDC asked everyone to actively participate in and follow the current Social Distancing
campaign/policy effective until 5 May.
- KCDC recommended that any facility that makes it easy for people to come in close contact with other
people in an enclosed space should refrain from operating as much as possible. Such facilities that
have to remain in operation should comply with infection prevention/control guidelines including
checking for fever or respiratory symptoms and keeping a log of all users, requiring everyone to wear
facemasks and keep distance from each other, and disinfecting and ventilating the space.
- KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible and maintaining personal
hygiene are highly important to preventing COVID-19.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance
from others, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or
leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
○ KCDC stated that even during COVID-19 outbreak, children and the elderly should receive
immunization under safe environment with infection prevention measures in place.
- It is important to prepare for potential outbreaks of other infectious diseases such as chickenpox,
mumps, and measles due to school reopening, increase in outdoor activities, and/or increase in
international exchange once the COVID-19 outbreak ends.
- Also, pneumococcal infection and its complications can be fatal for the elderly.
- Therefore, it is important to make appointments in advance to receive vaccination on recommended
immunization schedule.
