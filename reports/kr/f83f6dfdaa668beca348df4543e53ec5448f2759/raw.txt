○ National Instutite of Health(NIH) stated that the first meeting of 'inter-governmental support task force
for development of COVID-19 treatment and vaccine' was held on 24 April, and that it will strengthen
the continuous cooperation system between governments, industry, academia, research institutes, and
hospitals.
- There are 7 researches undergoing to expand biological activities for existing drugs to COVID-19,
including 4 supported by governemnt and 3 supported by private companies.
- On the other hand, development of antibody and plasma treatment based on the blood of recovered
patients is ongoing by cooperation between NIH and private sector.
- Regarding vaccines, while NIH is currently trying to discover candidate substances based on the
platform technology, private sector is also developing ways to evaluate its effectiveness once vaccine is
developed.
- Since it is still unknown which type of vaccine will be effective, nucleic acid, recombinant protein, viral
vector and etc, are all considered with open possibility for development in form of public-private
partnership.
○ Stressing that COVID-19 outbreak is still ongoing even though the number of new confirmed cases
has been small lately, KCDC asked people to actively cooperate in Social Distancing and asked people
to be careful this weekend regarding religious facilities and nightlife facilities.
- KCDC recommends people to participate in religious functions via non-face-to-face methods such as
online worship/meetings. Religious facilities that host on-site events must check people for fever, keep
distance between people, require everyone to wear facemasks, and refrain from activities that may cause
respiratory droplets to travel such as choir, shouting, or chanting.
- People in high-risk groups (e.g. pregnant women, elderly aged 65 or older, people with chronic illness)
should especially stay away from visiting enclosed spaces with a lot of people.
- Nightlife entertainment venues are also recommended to refrain from operating as much as possible.
Such venues that remain operating must comply with infection prevention/control measures including
checking people for fever or respiratory symptoms and disinfecting/ventilating thoroughly.
- People are recommended to refrain from visiting any enclosed space with poor ventilation or any place
that are frequented by a lot of people. People who cannot avoid visiting such enclosed/crowded places
should keep at least 2 meters away from other people, wear a facemask, refrain from handshakes, wash
hands, and refrain from touching eyes/nose/mouth.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or
leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
- KCDC also urged people to get tested early if more than 2-3 people at work or family unit develop
COVID-19 suspected symptoms such as fever or coughing.
