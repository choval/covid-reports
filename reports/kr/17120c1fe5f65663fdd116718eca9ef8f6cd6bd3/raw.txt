announced that the MERS situation regarding the confirmed
case from Sept. 8th will come to a close on Oct. 16, 00:00, in
accordance with standards designated by the WHO*.

of the 14-day monitoring period for MERS) following the date of the confirmed
case’s negative test results (Sept. 17).

○ The National Infectious Disease Risk Alert Level was lowered
from YELLOW to BLUE at 00:00 on Sept. 22 following a risk
assessment meeting on Sept. 21, determining that the risk of
additional spread from the confirmed case was very low.
□ Taking into consideration that there is always a risk of MERS imported

MERS response measures and improve upon them, as necessary.

□ When visiting the Middle East, individuals are advised to maintain
proper personal hygiene, such as washing hand frequently, and
to avoid visits to local farms, contact with camels, consumption
of raw camel meat or camel milk, and unnecessary visits to local
medical facilities.
○ Individuals are asked to cooperate with quarantine procedures,
such as honestly completing health status questionnaires at time
of entry. Those who experience any MERS-related symptoms
(fever, cough, shortness of breath) are advised to report their
symptoms to the KCDC 1339 call center or their local public
health center for further instructions.
○ Healthcare providers are advised to check the travel history of
incoming patients with respiratory symptoms to see if they have
recently traveled to the Middle East. The travel history of
Korean nationals can be checked through the Drug Usage
Review (DUR) system, while that of foreign nationals can be
checked through direct questioning. Healthcare providers should
report any patients suspected of MERS-CoV infection to local
public health centers or call the KCDC Call Center at 1339.
