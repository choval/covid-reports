 Close and Casual Contacts
○ Close Contacts (Active Surveillance*) : 21 individuals, no change as of yesterday
* Active Surveillance: Taking into consideration that these individuals had close contact with
the confirmed case, self-isolation and daily monitoring for potential symptoms are being
conducted.
- Seoul (10), Incheon (7), Gyeonggi (2), Busan (1), Gwangju (1)

- 1 -

○ Casual Contacts (Active Monitoring*) : 431 individuals, an increase of 3 from 18:00 yesterday
(+3, 428→431)
* Active Monitoring: Taking into consideration that these individuals had low levels of contact
with the confirmed case, daily monitoring for potential symptoms is being conducted.
* Casual contacts with unconfirmed whereabouts : 4 foreign nationals (tracking underway in
collaboration with the National Police Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs)
- Casual contacts from same plane increased by 2 (+2, 343→345)*, and other casual
contacts increased by 1 (+1, 85→86)**
* Numbers were adjusted to include two individuals who subsequently sat in the same and
adjacent seat on the same airplane during the next flight
** Numbers were adjusted to include customers who subsequently rode in the same taxi that
the confirmed case had taken

Ⅱ. Measures Taken
□ MERS Confirmation Test Conducted on All Close Contacts
○ After the average incubation period (6 days) has passed, MERS confirmation testing was
conducted for strict monitoring of close contacts
* Test results will be available tomorrow
- Confirmation tests are scheduled for Sept. 13th and Sept. 20th, the sixth (average
incubation period) and thirteenth (before the end of the incubation period) day after
suspected exposure, respectively
□ Team of KCDC epidemiological officers and private experts dispatched to Kuwait (Sept. 13th)
○ A team of 2 KCDC epidemiological officers and 1 private expert was dispatched to Kuwait
to conduct investigations on the health status and management of on-site contacts of the
confirmed case and to gather local epidemiological information
□ Number of foreign nationals with unconfirmed whereabouts down to 4; number of taxi customers
increased by 1 (successfully contacted)
○ 23 of the 27 casual contacts of foreign nationality whose whereabouts had not been
confirmed as of Sept. 12 have now been confirmed (-23, 27->4). 4 individuals remain
unconfirmed.
○ Records showed that the taxi taken by the confirmed case made 24 other stops, and 1
additional passenger was confirmed (+1, 27->28 total passengers). All passengers have
been identified and contacted, and none of them show any symptoms.

- 2 -

* 27 individuals are being managed as casual contacts (the remaining 1 individual is abroad
and is undergoing constant monitoring)

Ⅲ. Message to the Public
□ KCDC announced that it is collaborating closely with the Seoul Metropolitan Government and other
local governments to conduct thorough contact tracing and management of the situation to prevent
further spread of the disease.
○ When visiting the Middle East, the general public is advised to maintain proper personal hygiene,
such as washing hands frequently, and to avoid visits to local farms, contact with camels,
consumption of raw camel meat or camel milk, and unnecessary visits to local medical facilities.
- Individuals are asked to cooperate with quarantine procedures, such as honestly completing health
status questionnaires at the time of entry, and to report any symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness
of breath within 2 weeks after returning home. Should individuals experience such symptoms,
they are advised to call the KCDC Call Center at 1339 or local public health centers to report
their symptoms before visiting hospitals.
○ Healthcare providers should check the travel history of incoming patients with respiratory symptoms
to see if they have recently traveled to the Middle East. The travel history of Korean nationals
can be checked through the Drug Usage Review (DUR) system, while that of foreign nationals
can be checked through direct interviews. Healthcare providers should report any patients
suspected of MERS-CoV infection to local public health centers or call the KCDC Call Center
at 1339.

* Additional information on the current situation will be provided upon further epidemiological
investigation to ensure rapid, accurate, and transparent communication with the public.

Management of Close and Casual Contacts

1

 Close Contacts
ㅇ Taking into consideration that close contacts had high levels of contact
with

the

confirmed

case,

they

are

undergoing

isolation

and

daily

monitoring for symptoms
- (Active Surveillance) During the incubation period, close contacts are
contacted twice per day by a local government representative to check
for fever or respiratory symptoms
- (Self-isolation or Isolation at a Facility) During the incubation period,
close contacts are isolated to restrict movement and prevent contact
with others while symptoms are monitored

 Casual Contacts
ㅇ Taking into consideration that casual contacts had low levels of contact
with the confirmed case, they are undergoing daily monitoring for
symptoms
- (Active Monitoring) Although passive surveillance is the standard procedure
for casual contacts, active monitoring is being implemented in order to
strengthen prevention and control measures. As part of active monitoring, a
local government representative contacts casual contacts by phone once
per day during the incubation period to check for fever or respiratory
symptoms
* Casual contacts are informed to contact their local public health center
representative if they experience fever or respiratory symptoms during the
incubation period

 Suspected Cases
- 4 -

ㅇ Individuals under monitoring who experience fever or respiratory symptoms
and meet the criteria are classified as suspected cases and undergo further
testing
- (Isolation and Testing) Suspected cases are isolated and samples are taken
for MERS confirmation testing
* Should tests return negative, individuals return to standard monitoring
procedures according to their contact classification (i.e., close or casual)

Middle East
Overview

Respiratory

Syndrome

(MERS)

Details
▫MERS cases have been identified in the Middle East around the Arabian
Peninsula, with approximately 2,229 confirmed cases around the world from

Cases and
Outbreaks

2012 to June 30, 2018 (according to WHO)
▫Since January 2018, there have been 116 confirmed MERS cases (as of
September 8, 2018) in the Middle East (114 in Saudi Arabia*, 1 in UAE, 1
in Oman)
* One case was infected in Saudi Arabia and imported the virus to the UK

Pathogen

▫Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ; MERS-CoV
▫Although the mode of transmission is uncertain, animal-to-human transmission has

Mode of
Transmission

been observed through contact with infected camels and consumption of camel meat
and milk, and limited direct and indirect human-to-human transmission has been
observed through droplet infection following close contact with infected individuals

Incubation
Period

▫Approximately 2-14 days
▫MERS patients usually experience fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath,
and other respiratory symptoms. They may also suffer from diarrhea, vomiting,

Symptoms and
Clinical Course

and other gastrointestinal symptoms.
▫Many patients have low lymphocyte or platelet counts
▫Case Fatality Rate: The prognosis for those with pre-existing conditions or
weakened immune systems is rather poor, with a fatality rate of approximately
30%

Diagnosis

Treatment

Case
Management

▫Routing confirmation is conducted by RT-PCR testing of unique sequences of viral
RNA; confirmation by nucleic sequencing can be conducted when necessary
▫There is no cure for MERS, but individuals can be treated for their symptoms

▫Cases: Isolation of suspected or confirmed cases
▫Close Contacts: Passive surveillance of contacts of suspected cases, isolation and
active surveillance of contacts of confirmed cases

▫Hand washing, cough etiquette, and maintaining proper personal hygiene

Prevention

▫For travelers to the Middle East
- Avoid contact with camels and crowded areas; wear a mask if you experience
respiratory symptoms; avoid contact with those who have respiratory symptoms
