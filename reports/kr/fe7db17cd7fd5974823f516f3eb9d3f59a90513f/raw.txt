○ Korea National Institute of Health (of KCDC) announced that it will host the first meeting of the
intergovernmental working-level task force on COVID-19 response on Wednesday, 22 April.
- The task force is co-headed by Director of National Institute of Health and Deputy Minister of R&D
Policy (of Ministry of Science and ICT).
- Topics for discussion for the first meeting includes ways to respond to the supply and demand
changes, promote domestic manufacturing, and provide support for export of infection
prevention/control supplies and equipment.
○ KCDC asked everyone to actively participate in and follow the current Social Distancing
campaign/policy effective until 5 May.
- KCDC recommended that any facility that makes it easy for people to come in close contact with other
people in an enclosed space should refrain from operating as much as possible. Such facilities that
have to remain in operation should comply with infection prevention/control guidelines including
checking all users for fever or respiratory symptoms, keeping a log of all users, requiring everyone to
wear facemasks and keep distance from each other, and disinfecting and ventilating the space.
- KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible and maintaining personal
hygiene are highly important to preventing COVID-19.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance
from others, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or
leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
