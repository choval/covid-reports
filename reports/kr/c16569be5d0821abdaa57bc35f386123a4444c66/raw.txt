Person in charge : Choi Eun Kyung(Division of Infectious Disease Control, 043-719-7109)

◇ There has been a recent increase in Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection cases
◇ As incidence rates are high among children aged 6 years and under, the following
prevention guidelines should be followed:
- Promoting proper hand-washing habits, avoiding shared facilities, sterilizing infant

◇

Stricter prevention and control measures for respiratory infectious diseases are
advised in post-partum care facilities, childcare facilities, and other areas posing
risk through close contact

□ In response to the recent, steady increase* of 0-6 year old children admitted to
hospitals for RSV infection, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(KCDC, Director Jeong Eun-Kyeong) has advised stricter measures for prevention
and control of respiratory infectious diseases, especially in post-partum and
childcare facilities.

○ As of Week 47 of 2017 (11.19~11.25), RSV accounts for the highest percentage of
patients admitted for respiratory infections, and young children aged 0-6 years
account for 96.2%** of these cases.

* Number of admitted RSV patients among monitored sample of patients with acute respiratory
infections: 581 as of Week 44 of ’17 (10.29∼11.4.) → 784 as of Week 45 (11.5∼11.11.) → 882 as
of Week 46 (11.12∼11.18) → 1,089 as of Week 47 (11.19∼11.25)
** According to data from Week 47 of 2017, 1,048 of 1089 RSV admitted patients were aged 0-6 years.

○ In toddlers and infants under the age of 2 years, RSV often presents itself with
symptoms similar to those of the common cold, with the risk of progressing to
bronchiolitis or pneumonia if left untreated. In the Republic of Korea, RSV
infections are most prevalent from October to March of the following year. Due to
the risk of reinfection during the epidemic period, strict prevention and control
measures for respiratory infections should be taken every year.

□ KCDC requests

the strengthening of prevention and control of RSV, particularly

through the use of guidelines and press material, especially in post-partum and
other care facilities.

It also requests the practice of strict isolation and infection

control for patients admitted with RSV infection.
