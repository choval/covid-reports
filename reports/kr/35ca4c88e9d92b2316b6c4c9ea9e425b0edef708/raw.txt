○ Epidemiological links have been found for 81.2% of the total cases; 9.6% are either under investigation
or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in
Table 3.
○ From Hanseong Internal Medicine Clinic in Gyeonggi Province, 1 case (a dialysis outpatient of the
clinic) was confirmed on 11 April. Upon contact investigation, 5 additional cases were confirmed. Further
epidemiological investigation is underway. In total, 6 cases (patients = 2; staff/worker = 1;
family/guardians/other contacts = 3) have been confirmed.
○ From Yecheon-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, 3 additional cases were confirmed during contact
investigation. In total, 34 cases (including 2 in Andong City and 1 in Mungyeong City) have been

○ As of 17 April, of the 7,829 cases that have been discharged from isolation, 163 (2.1% of 7,829) have
tested positive again after being discharged from isolation (referred to as “retested-positive cases” below).
- On average, it took 13.5 days (min 1 day; max 35 days) between discharge from isolation and retesting
positive.
- Of the 137 retested-positive cases with reported clinical and epidemiological information, 61(43.9%)
cases were symptomatic. All of the 61 symptomatic cases had mild symptoms.
- Of the 294 contacts of the retested-positive cases, 38 have finished 14-day monitoring period and 256
are under monitoring. As of date, no secondary infection has been reported. Among contacts, 13
confirmed cases (family members living together) have been reported, all of whom are cases that
retested positive and not new cases.
- For viral infectivity assessment, 28 samples of retested-positive cases were collected. Of the 6 initial
samples, no virus was cultured. The other 22 are undergoing viral culture test.
- KCDC prepared and distributed a response plan for retested-positive cases on 14 April. Based on
findings from contact tracing and management and viral culture tests to find the causes and
transmissibility, KCDC will adjust its response accordingly.
- The response plan includes 14-day home quarantine recommendation and monitoring of symptoms for
cases upon discharge from isolation. In general, retested-positive cases will be handled in the same way
as first-time confirmed cases in areas such as contact investigation, admission to treatment facilities,
discharge from isolation.
○ Although the number of confirmed cases has seen a decline recently, there is still a risk that infection
may spread rapidly if close contacts occur because people who are unaware that they are infected visit
enclosed environment (such as PC cafe, public baths/sauna, bars), as is the case of the Yecheon-gun
cluster. KCDC urged everyone to continue to follow social distancing and personal hygiene guidelines
during the weekend.
- KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible, washing hands thoroughly,
and if having suspected symptoms, refraining from going to work or leaving home and going to a
screening clinic to get tested are the most important and effective measures against COVID-19.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance
from other people, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand
sanitizers.
- KCDC urged young people to avoid enclosed spaces such as nightclubs, bars, and cafes and to refrain
from social gatherings that may involve coming in close contact with other people.
Call to actions for all citizens
① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel
plans.
* There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and
events involving sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do
not go to work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
③ Avoid leaving home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to
work.
④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from
each other.
⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal
hygiene.
⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.
