○ On 20 April, the inter-governmental support task force for development of COVID-19 treatment and
vaccine launched a support center at Korea Health Industry Development Institute.
- Contact information:
- Vaccine: +82-2-2095-1748
- Treatment: +82-2-2095-1733
- Infection prevention/control supplies and equipment: +82-2095-1723
- The task force will learn about various challenges through 1:1 consultation with relevant organizations
and forward them to the working-level task force. It will also provide feedback on the decisions made
by the working-level task force.
○ KCDC asked everyone to actively participate in and follow the current Social Distancing
campaign/policy effective until 5 May.
- KCDC recommended that any facility that makes it easy for people to come in close contact with other
people in an enclosed space should refrain from operating as much as possible. Such facilities that
have to remain in operation should comply with infection prevention/control guidelines including
checking for fever or respiratory symptoms and keeping a log of all users, requiring everyone to wear
facemasks and keep distance from each other, and disinfecting and ventilating the space.
- KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible and maintaining personal
hygiene are highly important to preventing COVID-19.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance
from others, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or
leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
○ KCDC participated in the “Relay Support and Encouragement for Healthcare Workers” campaign called
#ThanksToYouChallenge proposed by the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters at
KCDC Emergency Operation Center, expressing gratitude to healthcare workers and citizens for their
contribution to Korea’s COVID-19 response.
○ KCDC Director Dr. Jung Eun-Kyeong and KCDC staff practiced the sign language for “Respect” to
remember the sacrificial dedication of healthcare workers in the frontlines who are fighting COVID-19 day
and night for 3 months at the forefront.
