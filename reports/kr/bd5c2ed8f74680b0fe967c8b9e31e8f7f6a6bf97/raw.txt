The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently
announced its “2nd Comprehensive Plan for TB Management,” with the
goal of reducing the incidence rate of TB by half by the year 2022.
The “1st Comprehensive Plan for TB Management (2013-2017)” was
previously introduced with the goal of reducing the TB incidence rate by
half compared to that of 2011 by 2020 (50 cases per 100,000).

ㅇ This resulted in a 5.8% reduction in the number of new TB cases by
2011, with case numbers reaching their lowest in 2017.

ㅇ Despite fewer instances of TB, there is still a need for effective TB management

due to risk factors in an aging population and potential threats of importation
from abroad. As the leading OECD country in TB incidence and fatality rates,
there is a clear need for stronger efforts in TB control and prevention.

□ Under the vision of “A Society without TB, Toward a Healthier Nation,”

the 2nd Plan presents four objectives as part of its strategy over the next
five years: ① TB Prevention and control through early detection; ② Patient-focused TB
management and support;

③ Research/development

and diagnostics; and

④ Establishing

systems for national/international cooperation.

ㅇ By 2022, the plan aims to reduce the incidence rate of TB, based on WHO
statistics, by half (from 77 cases per 100,000 in 2016 to 40 cases per 100,000 by
2022). This is part of the ultimate goal of TB eradication (fewer than 10 cases
per 100,000) by 2035.
