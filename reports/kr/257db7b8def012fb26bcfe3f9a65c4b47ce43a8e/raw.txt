 Close and Casual Contacts
○ Close Contacts (Active Surveillance*) : 21 individuals, no change as of yesterday
* Active Surveillance: Taking into consideration that these individuals had close contact with
the confirmed case, self-isolation (home-isolation) and daily monitoring for potential
symptoms are being conducted.
- Seoul (10), Incheon (5), Gyeonggi (3), Daejeon (1), Busan (1), Gwangju (1)
○ Casual Contacts (Active Monitoring*) : 425 individuals, no change as of 18:00 yesterday
* Active Monitoring: Taking into consideration that these individuals had low levels of contact
with the confirmed case, daily monitoring for potential symptoms is being conducted.
* Casual contacts with unconfirmed whereabouts : 1 foreign national (tracking underway in
collaboration with the National Police Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs)
- Casual contacts from same plane: 340; Other casual contacts: 85

II. Message to the Public
□ KCDC announced that it is collaborating closely with the Seoul Metropolitan Government and other
local governments to conduct thorough contact tracing and management of the situation to prevent
further spread of the disease.
○ KCDC would like to express its appreciation to the close and casual contacts of the confirmed
case for their active cooperation. During the remaining duration of the incubation period, contacts
are asked to continue cooperating with monitoring procedures. Individuals who experience any
MERS-like symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) are advised not to visit hospitals directly*;
instead, they should report their symptoms to the KCDC 1339 Call Center or their local public
health center and follow their instructions.
* There is a risk of infecting other individuals by visiting hospitals and emergency rooms.
○ Healthcare providers are advised to check the travel history of incoming patients with respiratory
symptoms to see if they have recently traveled to the Middle East. The travel history of Korean
nationals can be checked through the Drug Usage Review (DUR) system, while that of foreign
nationals can be checked through direct questioning. Healthcare providers should report any
patients suspected of MERS-CoV infection to local public health centers or call the KCDC Call
Center at 1339.

○ When visiting the Middle East, individuals are advised to maintain proper personal hygiene, such
as washing hands frequently, and to avoid visits to local farms, contact with camels, consumption
of raw camel meat or camel milk, and unnecessary visits to local medical facilities.
- Individuals are asked to cooperate with quarantine procedures, such as honestly completing health
status questionnaires at the time of entry.

* Additional information on the current situation will be provided upon further epidemiological
investigation to ensure rapid, accurate, and transparent communication with the public.

Management of Close and Casual Contacts

1

 Close Contacts
ㅇ Taking into consideration that close contacts had high levels of contact
with

the

confirmed

case,

they

are

undergoing

isolation

and

daily

monitoring for symptoms
- (Active Surveillance) During the incubation period, close contacts are
contacted twice per day by a local government representative to check
for fever or respiratory symptoms
- (Self-isolation/Home isolation or Isolation at a Facility) During the
incubation period, close contacts are isolated to restrict movement and
prevent contact with others while symptoms are monitored

 Casual Contacts
ㅇ Taking into consideration that casual contacts had low levels of contact
with the confirmed case, they are undergoing daily monitoring for
symptoms
- (Active Monitoring) Although passive surveillance* is the standard procedure
for casual contacts, active monitoring is being implemented in order to
strengthen prevention and control measures. As part of active monitoring, a
local government representative contacts casual contacts by phone once
per day during the incubation period to check for fever or respiratory
symptoms
* Passive surveillance: casual contacts are informed to contact their local
public health center representative if they experience fever or respiratory
symptoms during the incubation period

- 4 -

 Suspected Cases
ㅇ Individuals under monitoring who experience fever or respiratory symptoms
and meet the criteria are classified as suspected cases and undergo further
testing
- (Isolation and Testing) Suspected cases are isolated and samples are taken
for MERS confirmation testing
* Should tests return negative, individuals return to standard monitoring
procedures according to their contact classification (i.e., close or casual)

Middle East
Overview

Respiratory

Syndrome

(MERS)

Details
▫MERS cases have been identified in the Middle East around the Arabian
Peninsula, with approximately 2,229 confirmed cases around the world from

Cases and
Outbreaks

2012 to June 30, 2018 (according to WHO)
▫Since January 2018, there have been 116 confirmed MERS cases (as of
September 8, 2018) in the Middle East (114 in Saudi Arabia*, 1 in UAE, 1
in Oman)
* One case was infected in Saudi Arabia and imported the virus to the UK

Pathogen

▫Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ; MERS-CoV
▫Although the mode of transmission is uncertain, animal-to-human transmission has

Mode of
Transmission

been observed through contact with infected camels and consumption of camel meat
and milk, and limited direct and indirect human-to-human transmission has been
observed through droplet infection following close contact with infected individuals

Incubation
Period

▫Approximately 2-14 days
▫MERS patients usually experience fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath,
and other respiratory symptoms. They may also suffer from diarrhea, vomiting,

Symptoms and
Clinical Course

and other gastrointestinal symptoms.
▫Many patients have low lymphocyte or platelet counts
▫Case Fatality Rate: The prognosis for those with pre-existing conditions or
weakened immune systems is rather poor, with a fatality rate of approximately
30%

Diagnosis

Treatment

Case
Management

▫Routing confirmation is conducted by RT-PCR testing of unique sequences of viral
RNA; confirmation by nucleic sequencing can be conducted when necessary
▫There is no cure for MERS, but individuals can be treated for their symptoms

▫Cases: Isolation of suspected or confirmed cases
▫Close Contacts: Passive surveillance of contacts of suspected cases, isolation and
active surveillance of contacts of confirmed cases

▫Hand washing, cough etiquette, and maintaining proper personal hygiene

Prevention

▫For travelers to the Middle East
- Avoid contact with camels and crowded areas; wear a mask if you experience
respiratory symptoms; avoid contact with those who have respiratory symptoms
