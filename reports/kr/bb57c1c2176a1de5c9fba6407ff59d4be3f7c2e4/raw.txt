□ In response to the first Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome
(SFTS) case of 2018, which was confirmed in Jeju on April 9th, the Korea
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has advised the public
to take the following measures in preventing tick bites:
- Wear appropriate clothing (long sleeved shirts, pants, etc.)
to cover any exposed skin during outdoor activities
- Change and wash clothing that was worn outside
- Bathe or shower promptly after returning indoors
○ The peak risk period for SFTS, which is transmitted through the bites
of infected ticks, is from April to November, when ticks carrying the SFTS
virus are most active. Since 2013, there have been 607 confirmed cases
and 127 deaths.

□ Preventing tick bites during outdoor activities, including agricultural work
and hiking, is the most important step in protecting against SFTS.
○ Individuals aged 50 and over who work in agriculture or forestry are
at a proportionally greater risk of contracting the disease and should
take special precautions to protect themselves.
○ Individuals who experience high fever (38-40℃) and gastrointestinal
symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, within two weeks
following outdoor activity should seek medical attention as soon as possible
