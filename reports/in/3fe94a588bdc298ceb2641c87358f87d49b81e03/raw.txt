Coronaviruses cause disease in a wide variety of animal species.
SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and

Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected
humans.

coronaviruses may be transmitted from person to person either through droplets or
