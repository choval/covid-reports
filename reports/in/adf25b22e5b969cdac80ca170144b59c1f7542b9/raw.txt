The Central Government had shared elaborate guidelines on Social Distancing with all

States/UTs issued necessary guidelines in this regard, the measures taken by the States

Dear Colleagues,
This has reference to my previous communications to you with regard to
dealing with the nCoronavirus/Covid-19 challenge
A number of measures have been taken both by Govt of India and by the
States to contain Covid-19. These include dissemination of Do's & Don'ts, guidelines
on wearing of masks, action on various travel advisories, implementation of
protocols on surveillance, prevention of hospital infection, discharge policy, clinical
management, etc.
Detailed consultation with public health experts have suggested to focus on
social distancing measures as a preventive strategy to prevent and contain
transmission of this disease. It was brought out that implementation of social
distancing measures would have a major impact in limiting the spread and will also
provide us with time to strengthen our response framework.
Accordingly, advisory/guidelines are drawn up for further action. While
implementing these measures, it is impoftant to educate the community so as to
ensure their cooperation and avoid any panic. It is reiterated that these are
preventive measures so as to lessen the impact of COVID-19 in the country and are
temporary.
I take this opportunity to thank you and your team for the tremendous hard
work that you are putting in to keep our country safe.
The advisory is enclosed for fufther action'

Dear Colleague,
Let me place on record my appreciation for the great work done by all
the states in limiting the spread of COVID-L9. Without your support it would
not have been possible. Continued and constant vigil is important.
2. As part of our management efforts, there is a need to impose certain
social distancing measures such as quarantine of exposed healthy individuals
who could be potential patients or isolation of those with symptoms. Such
measures require great degree of persuasive communication. The persons to
be quarantined or isolated need to volunteer for such measures in greater
interest of the nation.
3. There might however be cases where, in larger community interest we
may have to issue instructions to non-cooperative individuals. ln this context it
is highlighted that legal provisions to support States in there endeavor to
manage infectious diseases exist. These include Epidemic Act of '1,897, Disaster
Management Act and various other provisions under IPC and Criminal
Procedure Code etc.
4. As states get empowered under the Epidemic Disease Act and other
provisions, in our public narrative and press briefings, we have to make it very
clear that there is no epidemic of COVID-19 in the country. All such actions are
primarily legal empowerment for the preventive action that requires to be
ta ken.
The same may kindly be noted.
