Guidelines for notifying COVID-19 affected persons
by Private Institutions
In the wake of the prevailing COVID-19 situation and in order to
strengthen the containment measures, it is of utmost importance that
each and every case (suspects/confirmed) of COVID-19 is isolated and
provided appropriate treatment and their contacts are traced at the
earliest to break the chain of transmission. It is important that support
and cooperation of private sector is enlisted, in this regard.
Therefore, it shall be mandatory for all hospitals (Government and
Private), Medical officers in Government health institutions and
registered Private Medical Practitioners including AYUSH
Practitioners, to notify such person(s) with COVID-19 affected person
(as defined in the attached annexure) to concerned district
surveillance unit. All practitioners shall also get the self-declaration
forms (enclosed), who, within their knowledge, are having travel
history of COVID-19 affected countries as per the extant guidelines
and are falling under the case definition of COVID-19 (Suspect/Case)
In case the person has any such history in the last 14 days and is
symptomatic as per case definition of COVID-19, the person must be
isolated in the hospital and will be tested for COVID-19 as per
protocol.
Information of all such cases should be given to the State helpline
number (list enclosed) and also to national helpline 1075. Email may
also be sent at ncov2019@gov.in.
