PREVENTION - WHAT TO DO?
HAND HYGIENE
DO
DO NOT
Hand hygiene is a way of cleaning one's hands that substantially reduces potential pathogens (harmful germs) on the hands.
Hand hygiene procedures include hand washing with soap and water for at least 40 secs or use of 70% alcohol-
based hand rubs
▪ WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN WITH SOAP AND WATER FOR 40
SECONDS ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN IN A PUBLIC
PLACE, OR AFTER BLOWING YOUR NOSE, COUGHING, OR
SNEEZING.
▪ USE A HAND SANITISER (AT LEAST 70% ALCOHOL BASED) IF
SOAP AND WATER NOT AVAILABLE COVER ALL SURFACES
OF YOUR HANDS AND RUB THEM TOGETHER UNTIL THEY
FEEL DRY.
▪ TOUCH YOUR EYES, NOSE, AND MOUTH WITH
UNWASHED HANDS.
▪ TOUCH SURFACES LIKE DOOR KNOBS AND
DOOR BELLS, ELEVATOR BUTTONS, HANDRAILS,
SUPPORT HANDLES, CHAIR BACKS, ATM
SURFACES, MOBILES, JEEP HANDLES ETC
PREVENTION: RESPIRATORY HYGIENE
09
Respiratory Hygiene is a combination of measures taken to stop the spread of germs
through respiratory behaviours like coughing or sneezing
DO DO NOT
• DO USE a handkerchief or a tissue
to cover your face while coughing
or sneezing
• DO THROW the used tissue
immediately into a closed dustbin
• DO COVER your sneeze into your
bent upper arm in case you are not
carrying a tissue or a kerchief.
• DO WASH hands immediately after
you have covered your sneeze or
cough
• DO NOT use other ways of
covering your face like the pallu of
the sari of the chunni or the
gamcha
• DO NOT spit in the open, always
use a spittoon or wash basin for
spitting
CASE STUDY
10
QUESTION 1: IF YOU WERE THERE AS A CUSTOMER; WHAT WOULD
YOU HAVE DONE?
QUESTION 2: IF YOU WERE THE SHOPKEEPER, WHAT WOULD
YOU HAVE DONE?
QUESTION 3: AS A HEALTH WORKER WHAT WOULD YOU
ADVISE/COUNSEL?
ANSWERS
Smita has gone out to buy vegetables. She
has a sore throat and is often coughing
without covering her face. You are in the
shop when she comes and suddenly she
has a fit of cough. Everyone instantly
moves away from her and the shopkeeper
says angrily “Don’t come into my shop if
you are coughing.”
• It is good for people to move away and keep a
distance. However, as a fellow customer anyone could
give a polite advice to follow the correct respiratory
hygiene.
• It is wrong for the shopkeeper to have shouted at
Smita. This is stigmatising behaviour. Though
everyone is scared, being rude is not helpful. It will just
keep people away from reporting a problem if they feel
discriminated against. The shopkeeper can also keep
his shop infection free by wiping the counters with a
disinfectant regularly.
As a health worker my job will be:
• Counsel Smita that she must cover her face with a
handkerchief when coughing. Suggest her to get
medication at the PHC
• Counsel the shopkeeper that anyone can have a
cough and it need not be coronavirus infection.
However anyone can have the infection and therefore
he can help by keeping a box of tissues and hand
sanitizer on the counter or keep a washing station for
people to wash their hand.
• Counsel people on respiratory hygiene
11
SOCIAL DISTANCING : DELIBERATELY INCREASING THE PHYSICAL SPACE BETWEEN PEOPLE TO AVOID
SPREADING ILLNESS. STAYING AT LEAST ONE METER AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE LESSENS YOUR CHANCES OF
CATCHING COVID-19.
PREVENTION: SOCIAL DISTANCING
DO
DO
NOT
• DO NOT HOLD EVENTS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO
GATHER (EVEN IF IT IS A CORNER MEETING WITH
THREE OR FOUR FRIENDS, OR AN EVENING CHAT ON
THE CHAUPAL)
• DO NOT GO TO CROWDED PLACES LIKE MARKETS,
SHOPPING, MELAS, PARTIES
• DO NOT USE PUBLIC TRANSPORT
• STAY AT HOME UNLESS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
• KEEP A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST ONE METER
BETWEEN YOURSELF AND ANOTHER
PERSON
PREVENTION: HIGH RISK GROUP
HIGH RISK GROUPS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT A HIGHER RISK FROM SEVERE ILLNESS IF THEY
GET COVID-19. THIS INCLUDES:
PREGNANT
WOMEN
(AS WE DO NOT
KNOW THE
IMPACT OF THE
DISEASE ON
PREGNANCY AS
OF YET, IT IS

WHY IS THERE
STIGMA?
WHAT IS
STIGMA?
WHAT DOES
STIGMA DO?
WHATCAN
FLWDO?
26
• FALLING ILL AND DYING
• AVOIDING APPROACHING HEALTH FACILITIES DUE TO FEAR OF BECOMING
INFECTED WHILE IN CARE
• FEAR OF LOSING LIVELIHOODS, NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK DURING ISOLATION,
AND OF BEING DISMISSED FROM WORK
• FEAR OF BEING SOCIALLY EXCLUDED/PLACED IN QUARANTINE BECAUSE OF
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISEASE
• FEELING POWERLESS IN PROTECTING LOVED ONES AND FEAR OF LOSING LOVED
ONES BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS OR BEING SEPARATED DURING QUARANTINE
• FEELINGS OF HELPLESSNESS, BOREDOM, LONELINESS AND DEPRESSION DUE TO
BEING ISOLATED AND NOT WORKING TOWARDS CARING FOR A DEPENDENT
• STRESS IS CAUSED DUE TO THE ABOVE FEARS AND BEING TREATED AS AN
OUTCASTE OR BLAMED FOR SPREADING THE DISEASE
IN ANY EPIDEMIC, IT IS COMMON FOR INDIVIDUALS TO FEEL
STRESSED AND WORRIED BECAUSE THEY FEAR:
WHAT IS STIGMA?
27
THE LEVEL OF STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 IS BASED ON THREE MAIN FACTORS:
▪COVID-19 IS A NEW DISEASE ABOUT WHICH MANY THINGS ARE STILL BEING DISCOVERED.
▪WHEN SOMETHING IS UNKNOWN PEOPLE ARE WORRIED WHICH LEADS TO FEAR
▪RUMOURS OR FAKE NEWS GIVE WRONG INFORMATION AND SPREADS THE FEAR.
WHY IS THERE STIGMA?

31
CASE FROM PIPLI: WHAT CAN FLW DO?
Suresh was under home quarantine when his wife, developed labour pains and had to be taken to the hospital for
delivery. The ASHA assured Suresh that his wife will be taken care of while he should remain isolated within the
house as advised. The ASHA called her neighbour Seema and requested her to send food for Suresh. She reminded
Seema to take the precautions while giving food. She then called the convener of local mothers’ group and a member
of village health and nutrition committee (VHSNC) member and apprised both of them of the situation requesting them
to arrange for Suresh’s food and home-care requirements. The VHSNC member requested village youth group
members to do the needful for Suresh at-least for next 72 hours till his wife returns.
1. What are the positive actions taken by ASHA?
ASHA has proactively formed community support groups and planned in case of emergency
2. What should be done?
She informed her neighbour to give food
3. Which groups and /or people were involved by ASHA to provide supportive environment?
The neighbours, VHSNC (who in turn involved the Youth Groups) and Adolescent Girls groups
4. If you were in place of ASHA, what would you have done additionally?

isolate themselves to protect them from getting infected

day meals delivered to the children’s homes.

people who may possibly be infected and report it for referral.

PRACTICING SAFE BEHAVIOURS
44
Remember many daily wage / unorganized sector workers with severe economic
hardship would go to work despite restrictions increasing their vulnerability
Reach out to specific group of people such as labourers, housemaids, shelter
home migrants and daily wage workers and advise them to follow:
• Frequent handwashing with soap and water for 40 seconds especially
after coming from outside, before eating food and after going to toilet.
• Change clothes and if possible wash oneself using soap after coming from
outside. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
• Avoid spitting in open places and use only a wash basin or spittoon
• Maintain a distance of minimum 1 meter from others
• Contact community help-desk/ health facility if they develop fever, cough
or difficulty in breathing or need any information
Stigma and Discrimination
Remember urban areas are densely populated with limited health staff. You need to
develop community support to keep everyone and yourself safe.
1. Many of the societies have stopped maids and other helpers from entering. While this is
correct as this will keep people at home, the way of managing this distancing is stigmatizing
2. Words like “They will bring this disease to us” “The disease will spread because of them”
etc are stigmatizing
3. Work with the local influencers and key decisionmakers of the area to sensitise people
4. Use the mass media clips to sensitise
5. Use government orders to show why housing societies should not discriminate against the
working class like car cleaners, maids etc.
