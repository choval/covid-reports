Advisory for Human Resource Management of COVID-19
India reported its 1st
case of COVID-19 on 30th
January, 2020. It was a travel related case
from Wuhan, China. Since then (as on 29th
March, 2020), 979 confirmed cases and 25 deaths have
been reported from 27 States/UTs. Although there is no evidence to widespread community
transmission, 20 existing and 22 potential hotspots have been identified. The containment
measures to break the cycle of transmission and clinical management of those affected would
require large human resource (HR).
Scope of Document
This document provides guidance to the state on the human resource that can be mobilized for
COVID-19 management along with possible role assignments and their training requirements.
A. Human Resource
1. The major areas where enhanced deployment of HR is required:
i. Surveillance
a. Surveillance activities at grass root level.
b. Supervisory management of containment operations at grass root level.
c. Laboratory testing
d. Collection, collation and dissemination of data.
e. Risk Communication
ii. Clinical management
a. Clinical management of Suspect/confirmed cases in isolation wards.
b. Critical care management SARI cases in ICUs.
c. Patient transportation and referral
d. Cleaning, disinfection and waste management.
iii. Management of quarantine, isolation facilities, logistics and supply chain management
iv. Pyscho Social Care:
2. The HR pooled from various sources will be assigned roles to perform in the above
mentioned areas.
B. Capacity building
i. Such identified HR needs to be trained online using online training programs developed by
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).
ii. These trainings will be designed to suit requirement of each and every section of healthcare
worker involved in the containment operations.
iii. These trainings for different target groups shall cover:
a. Field surveillance, contact tracing, data management and reporting
b. Sampling, packaging and shipment of specimen
c. Hospital infection prevention and control including use of appropriate PPEs and
biomedical waste management
d. Clinical case management including ventilator management, critical care
management
e. Training of managers on managing quarantine and isolation facilities
f. Community based training in Pyscho â€“social care.
iv. Each State will identify and designate a Nodal officer for Training who will coordinate all
training activities in the State.
v. MoHFW will conduct trainings of Master trainers of organizationsfrom where field staff is
being deployed. Responsibility of further dissemination will be that of concerned
institution.
vi. The concerned organization will create a database of trained person who will disseminate
and convey the information to all the districts through MoHFW.
vii. For COVID-19 management, the district administration will pool-in the requisite human
resources.
viii. Such pooled human resources would stay in the containment zone till the containment
operations are over
ix. Isolation areas: in addition to training all hospital staff, dentists and AYUSH practitioners
available should also be trained.
x. Retired doctors and other healthcare professionals should be identified to work in non-
covid areas in hospitals in case of emergencies
C. Suggested numbers of HR
i. For surveillance activities: Covid Warriors @ 1 per 250 population may be identified and
trained.
ii. Quarantine facilities: these are meant to house asymptomatic cases. The number identified
and trained should be equal to the number of Covid Warriors.
iii. Ventilator use: at least two times the number of ICU beds earmarked for covid-19 patients
should be imparted one day training.
