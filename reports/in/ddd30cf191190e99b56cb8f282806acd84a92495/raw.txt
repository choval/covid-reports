Ayurveda’s immunity boosting measures for self care during COVID 19 crisis
In the wake of the Covid 19 outbreak, entire mankind across the globe is suffering.
Enhancing the body’s natural defence system (immunity) plays an important role
in maintaining optimum health.
We all know that prevention is better than cure. While there is no medicine for
COVID-19 as of now, it will be good to take preventive measures which boost our
immunity in these times.
Ayurveda, being the science of life, propagates the gifts of nature in maintaining
healthy and happy living. Ayurveda’s extensive knowledge base on preventive
care, derives from the concepts of “Dinacharya” - daily regimes and “Ritucharya”
- seasonal regimes to maintain healthy life. It is a plant-based science. The
simplicity of awareness about oneself and the harmony each individual can achieve
by uplifting and maintaining his or her immunity is emphasized across Ayurveda’s
classical scriptures.
Ministry of AYUSH recommends the following self-care guidelines for preventive
health measures and boosting immunity with special reference to respiratory
health. These are supported by Ayurvedic literature and scientific publications.
