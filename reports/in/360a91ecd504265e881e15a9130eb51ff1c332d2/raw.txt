1. Statement: With the summers
coming up, the Coronavirus will
be killed
FACT: The COVID-19 virus can be
transmitted in ALL AREAS, including
areas with hot and humid weather. The
best way to protect yourself against
COVID-19 is by frequently washing
your hands with soap and water,
covering your coughs and sneezes and
avoiding crowded places.
2. Statement: Having a bath with hot
water will kill the virus
FACT: The virus lives inside the body
where the temperature is maintained
at 37ºC and is not affected by a hot
water bath that you have.
3. Statement: Eating raw garlic,
sesame seeds will protect you against
the virus
FACT: Garlic is a healthy food that has
other benefits but does not protect
you against the Coronavirus.
4. Statement: Getting the pneumonia
vaccine will protect you against the
virus
FACT: While vaccines for Pneumonia
will certainly protect you against
pneumonia, it has no protective effect
against the Novel Coronavirus.
5. Statement: You can get COVID-19
through mosquito bites
FACT: The Coronavirus cannot be
spread through the bite of a mosquito.
It is spread thorough droplets spread
when an infected person sneezes or
coughs
6. Statement: Spraying alcohol or
disinfectant over your body can
prevent infection
FACT: Spraying with alcohol or
sanitizer on clothes and body, or
consuming alcohol will not prevent
you from getting infection. Infection
spreads when the virus enters the
body through nose or mouth. Cleaning
and wiping hands with alcohol is to
prevent the germ from entering your
system through infected hands when
you touch your mouth or you eat food
with infected hands.
7. Statement: Regularly rinsing the
nose with saline will prevent the
infection
FACT: Rinsing nose with saline has in
few cases helped in containing
common cold, but has no evidence to
suggest it is effective against the
Novel Coronavirus infection
