Overall testing for COVID-19 using real-time RT PCR is increasing and we will
be approaching full capacity in near future. At the same time, we are expecting
delivery of Rapid Test kits (blood based) for use in response to COVID-19 situation.
ln this regard, National Task Force deliberated with experts for ascertaining use of
these rapid test kits. Draft of the suggested algorithm was also discussed in detail
with technical experts from the Ministry and inputs were included in the final version
which is feasible for implementation in the field conditions.
Advisory to start rapid antibody based blood test for COVID-19, in clusters
(with containment zones), and in large migration gatherings/evacuees centresis now
available at
https://icmr.nic.in/sites/defaulVfiles/upload documents/Advisory Antibodv Testino 0404202
0.pdf.
The same may please be further disseminated to all States/UTs along with
operational guidelines for implementation and roles and responsibilities for
implementation. Reports of the tests may be entered by the respective facilities into
the ICMR portal similar to results of real-time RT PCR tests for COVID-19.
With regards,
Yours Sincerely ,

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH RESEARCH
Advisory to start rapid antibody based blood test for COVID-19 (4 April 2020)
Strategy for areas reporting clusters (containment zone) and in large migration
gatherings/evacuees centres
Cases of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) to be monitored in health facilities. Any surge in cases to be monitored
and brought to the notice of Surveillance Officer/CMO for additional investigation.
As a matter of abundant precautions, all symptomatic ILI persons should be advised home quarantine
for 14 days.
At facility level, symptomatic ILI individuals to be tested using rapid antibody tests.
o Antibody test negative:
 If warranted, confirm by real-time RT-PCR using throat/nasal swab.
 RT-PCR negative: Likely non-COVID-19 ILI
 RT-PCR positive: Confirmed COVID-19 Case and action as per protocol to be
initiated for isolation, treatment and contact tracing.
OR
 If real-time RT-PCR not done, home quarantine and repeat antibody testing after 10
days of the last rapid antibody test.
 Antibody test negative: Likely non-COVID-19 ILI.
 Antibody test positive: there is possibility of recent infection, quarantine for
another 10 days.
o Antibody test positive: After clinical assessment, treatment in hospital or isolation as per
protocol. Action as per protocol to be initiated for contact tracing.
If symptoms worsen, refer to designated COVID-19 hospitals.
When home quarantine is not feasible, consider facility-based quarantine.
General Guidelines:
 Healthcare workers doing the rapid antibody test to use gloves, mask, and head covers.
 Healthcare workers collecting throat/nasal swab to follow standard national infection control
guidelines.
 The rapid antibody tests approved by US-FDA/CE-IVD or non-CE-IVD validated by ICMR-NIV
with marketing approval by DCGI be used.
 In order to ensure that all such cases are monitored and necessary action is initiated with
respect to infectious disease management, details of all test results shall be uploaded in ICMR
portal.
 All such organizations are duty bound to register themselves to ICMR portal and upload the
data in real-time.
 Failure to do so, they will be held liable to action under Disaster Management Act, 2005.
