Sub: Precautions to be taken in light of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).
Ref: MHFW DO No.Z-21020/14/2020-PH dt. 17.03.2020
Dear Sir/Madam,
With reference to the above, it is necessary that adequate precautionary
measures are taken by various organizations to face the situation arising out of
COVID-19.
2. While maintenance of academic calendars and exam schedule is
important, equally important is the safety and security of the students who are
appearing in various examinations, as also that of their teachers and parents.
3. CBSE has already issued detailed instructions for the precautionary
measures to be taken at various examination and evaluation centers. However, it
is noted that during examinations, large number of parents/guardians accompany
their wards. Further, certain competitive examinations like JEE Mains require
examinees to travel to other centers and in some cases even to other cities, to
appear in the said examination.
4. There is also anxiety amongst many examinees, parents and teachers as
reflected in their e-mails to CBSE and on various social media platforms.
5. Therefore, following further precautionary measures are required to be
taken by all educational institutions and examination boards under the Ministry of
HRD:
Contd...2
2
(I) All ongoing examinations may be rescheduled after 31.03.2020. This
would include CBSE, NIOS as also University Exams.
(II) All evaluation work may be rescheduled after 31.03.2020. This would
include evaluation work of CBSE, NIOS as also University Exams.
(III) Since JEE Mains may require travel by examinees to different towns
and the dates may clash with rescheduled CBSE and other Board
exams therefore, JEE Mains should be rescheduled and new date of
JEE Mains will be announced on 31.03.2020 after re-assessment of
situation.
6. All Educational Institutions and Examination Boards are requested to
maintain regular communication with the students and teachers through
electronic means and keep them fully informed so that there is no anxiety
amongst the students, teachers and parents.
7. All institutions are also requested to notify help-line numbers/e-mails which
students can access for their queries.
8. All students, teachers and parents may be requested not to panic as
MHRD is committed to ensure safety and security of students as also the
maintenance of academic calendar and all possible steps will be taken in this
regard.
Yours sincerely,
(Amit Khare)
