Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) are one of the most
common adverse events in delivery of care and a major public
health problem with an impact on morbidity, mortality and quality
of life. At any one time, up to 7% of patients in developed and
10% in developing countries will acquire at least one HAI. These
infections also present a significant economic burden for the
health system.
2. However, a large percentage of HAIs are preventable through effective
Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. Infection prevention and control
is also important to prevent the occurrence and spread of infections, thereby
reducing the need for antibiotics. I congratulate National Centre for Disease Control
(NCDC) in taking the lead and developing these guidelines in collaboration with the
World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office. These guidelines are intended to
support hospitals and other healthcare facilities to establish their IPC protocols so
as to provide safer healthcare services to the people.
3. These new National Guidelines for IPC in Healthcare Facilities will enhance
the patient safety and the capacity of health workers to prevent and control infections
in Indian hospitals. These guidelines shall prevent current and future threats from
infectious diseases such as Nipah, Ebola, and will help in strengthening health
service resilience, combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and improve the overall
quality of healthcare delivery.
4. These guidelines are suitable for all those who are providing healthcare
services, especially those who are delivering tertiary care. These can be adapted
to local situations and patient profiles. I am sure that the guidelines will help in
setting global standards for controlling the HAIs and will be found useful by all the
stakeholders.
5. I convey my good wishes to NCDC and WHO for the release of the new
guidelines and wish them all the success in their future endeavours also.
(Dr HARSH VARDHAN)
x National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Infection prevention and control refers to measures aimed
at preventing and controlling infections and transmission of
infections in healthcare settings. Such healthcare-associated
infections may be acquired in healthcare settings.
These National Guidelines on Infection Prevention and Control in
Healthcare Facilities are endorsed by the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare to strengthen IPC practices in healthcare settings
across the country.
This document lays down the protocols and guidance required for the practice of a
nationally acceptable standard of IPC in healthcare settings. I am confident that this
document will be valuable for improving the quality of services, not only because
it was developed after extensive review of relevant literature and consultation with
experts, but also because its contents are realistic, practical, and designed to meet
local needs.
These guidelines are aligned to the National Patient Safety Implementation
Framework (2018–2025) as well as the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial
Resistance. I promise the support needed from the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare in implementing these guidelines.
I request all stakeholders to ensure that these guidelines are widely implemented in
healthcare facilities across the country to strengthen IPC systems thereby promoting
safe healthcare practices.

Healthcare-associated infections (HAI), also referred to as
“nosocomial” or “hospital” infections, occur in a patient during the
process of care in a hospital or other healthcare facility and were
not present or incubating at the time of admission. HAI can affect
patients in any type of setting where they receive care and can
also appear after discharge; and include occupational infections
among staff.
HAI are one of the most common adverse events in healthcare delivery and a
major public health problem with an impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of
life. At any one time, up to 7% of patients in developed and 10% in developing
countries will acquire at least one HAI. These infections also present a significant
economic burden to the society. However, a large percentage are preventable
through effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.
This document outlines the broad principles and practices of infection control that are
essential for the prevention of infection. It provides the framework to strengthen the
infrastructure and manpower needed to address infection prevention and control.
The Hospital Infection Control Team and Hospital Infection Control Committees are
critical mechanisms to systematically address IPC in any healthcare facility. The
infection control nurses are the key front-line professionals for implementing IPC in
any healthcare facility. Capacity development and trainings to develop the skills of
healthcare staff will also be crucial in implementing these guidelines.
I congratulate National Centre for Disease Control for developing these guidelines
in collaboration with WHO Country Office for India and look forward to their
implementation in all healthcare facilities in the country.

xii National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
WHO is proud to be associated with the development of these
National Guidelines for Infection Prevention Control in Healthcare
Facilities, as well as the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial
Resistance (NAP-AMR), National Patient Safety Implementation
Framework (2018–2025) and the National Guidelines for National
Patient Safety Implementation Framework – all of which identify
infection prevention and control (IPC) as a strategic priority.
The first principle of patient safety is to do no harm and prevention is best! Infection
control is key in prevention and is implemented through the infection prevention and
control (IPC) committees in healthcare facilities. Preventing infections is at the core
of public health and is also the best way to reduce the use of antimicrobials.
Hand hygiene is the simplest cost-effective intervention for preventing the spread
of infections not only in healthcare facilities but also in the community. WHO
launched the first Global Patient Safety Challenge – clean care is safer care – in
2005, focused on improving hand hygiene. It is also closely aligned to and can be
integrated under the Government’s Swachh Bharat Mission. Vaccines and the use
of reuse prevention (RUP) syringes are other methods than can avert infections.
Infection control nurses are the frontline workers for IPC. WHO has designated 2020
as the “Year of the Nurse and Midwife”, in honour of the 200th birth anniversary of
Florence Nightingale. Nurses play an important role in the care for patients and
preventing healthcare-associated infections, which includes educating the patients
and their families, ensuring hand hygiene and supporting antimicrobial stewardship.
I look forward to these new guidelines being implemented in all healthcare facilities.
I reiterate WHO’s commitment and support for infection prevention and control and
containment of antimicrobial resistance.

Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are one of the most
common complications of healthcare management. These are
serious health hazards as many are caused by the serious
antibiotic resistant bacteria leading to increase in the length of
hospital stay and the associated costs and may even lead to
death.
Healthcarefacilitiesarehighriskenvironmentsforthedevelopment
and spread of drug resistance and frequently have the highest burden of multidrug
resistant organisms (MDRO). Infection prevention and control measures and
practices reduce the opportunities for resistant pathogens to spread in healthcare
facilities. They are therefore important in our efforts to contain antimicrobial
resistance.
Standard precautions are the basics of IPC and should be observed in all health
facilities. Hand hygiene especially hand-washing is one of the simplest and cost-
effective interventions to prevent infections and combat antimicrobial resistance.
Surveillance of HAI is important to assess the burden, monitor trends and develop
evidence-based polices to address AMR and patient safety. Digital health and IT
solutions to monitor the trends of HAI through the Integrated Health Information
Portal of MoHFW will be one of our targets. Creating awareness about infections,
controlling antimicrobial resistance and ensuring access to safe healthcare will
need that these guidelines be implemented in letter and spirit across all healthcare
facilities.

xiv National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Effectiveinfectionpreventionandcontroliscentraltoprovidinghigh
quality healthcare for patients and a safe working environment for
those who work in healthcare settings. It is important to minimize
the risk of spread of infection to patients and staff in hospitals by
implementing a robust infection control programme.
Prevention of infections reduces the need to use antibiotics
and thereby reduces the use of antibiotics and development of
antimicrobial resistance. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is coordinating
the National Programme for AMR Containment and one of the objectives of the
programme is to strengthen infection prevention and control in state medical college
hospitals.
This document that has been meticulously prepared with inputs from various experts
across India, with support from the WHO Country Office for India. The overall aim
of this document is to provide evidence-based information in the prevention and
control of infections in healthcare settings. It is relevant to all staff including doctors,
nurses, other medical professionals and managers working in hospitals or clinics.
Surveillance of HAIs and monitoring and evaluation of HAIs in healthcare facilities is
an important tool to measure the burden of HAI and we look forward to strengthening
national data and information regarding HAIs to guide evidence-based policy
making for safer healthcare in India.

Healthcare-associated infection (HAI), previously referred to as “nosocomial” or
“hospital” infection, occurs in a patient during the process of care in a hospital or
other healthcare facility (HCF), but was not present or incubating at the time of
admission. HAIs include occupational infections among healthcare providers.
HAIs are one of the most common adverse events during healthcare delivery
and a major public health issue affecting morbidity, mortality and quality of life. At
any time, up to 7% of patients in developed and 10% in developing countries will
acquire at least one HAI,1
causing a considerable economic burden to the society.
However, HAIs are largely preventable through effective infection prevention and
control (IPC) measures.
It is evident that HAIs result in prolonged hospital stays, long-term disability,
increased resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials, additional cost on health
systems, high cost for patients and their family, and preventable deaths.
HCFs are high-risk environments for the development and spread of drug resistance
bacteria and frequently have the highest burden of multidrug-resistant organisms
(MDROs). IPC measures reduce the opportunities for resistant pathogens to spread
in HCFs and contribute to the containment of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
Global pandemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza and
Ebola, and the role of the HCF as an epicentre and amplifier of outbreaks, have
emphasized the importance of IPC. The 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, and
the death of a nurse who cared for an infected patient, has brought to the fore the
urgent need to improve IPC practices and put in place effective IPC programmes
both at the national as well as HCF levels.
Rising trends of AMR are a major concern. New Delhi metallo-E-lactamase (NDM)
producing bacteria first reported in 2008, are now found worldwide.2
From 2008
to 2013, Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins increased
from 70% to 83%, and resistance to fluoroquinolones increased from 78% to 85%.
Ten percent of E. coli isolates were resistant to carbapenems in 2008, increasing to
13% in 2013.3
In one tertiary-care hospital in New Delhi, resistance to carbapenem
among Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 2% in 2002 to 52% in 2009.4

use is a major driver of AMR. In 2010, India was the world’s largest consumer of
antibiotics for human health at 12.9u109
units (10.7 units per person).5
The key global and national initiatives for IPC are given in Box 1.1. The WHO
Guidelines on Core Components of Infection Control Programmes11
have been
formulated to help countries develop strategies to improve and strengthen IPC
programmes (Box 1.2). The guidelines provide evidence- and consensus-based
recommendations on the core components that are required to be in place at the
national and acute facility level to prevent HAI, and to combat current and future
infection threats and AMR through IPC good practices. The guideline document is
supported by a practical manual for implementation.18

Plan on AMR.19
The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have created a network of laboratories for
AMR surveillance in the country. Many private hospitals and autonomous institutes
have their own infection control systems. Network laboratories have been identified
for the surveillance of common bacterial pathogens of public health importance to
determine the magnitude and trends of AMR in different geographical regions of
India.
Standards for IPC have been defined for accreditation of HCFs by the National
Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH).20
A system of
surveillance for HAI has been established but it is limited only to NABH-accredited
hospitals.
The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and ICMR have jointly established
an HAI surveillance network of 35 centres from the public and private sectors. It has
developed a software to track HAIs.21
This document on the National Guidelines for IPC has been developed after due
process of review by experts from across the country and keeping in view the
guidelines developed by institutions/under various programmes, e.g. ICMR,22
National Health Mission (NHM),23
the Hospital Manual by the Directorate General
of Health Services (DGHS)24
and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO).25
Scope and purpose
This document integrates evidence-based, standard, internationally accepted IPC
practices for HCFs in India. Its key purpose is to support improvement in IPC at the
HCF level and control HAIs.

4 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
These guidelines are in alignment with the National Patient Safety Implementation
Framework and the National Action Plan on AMR, which identify IPC and HAI control
as priority areas to improve patient safety, healthcare quality and containment of
AMR in the country.
At the facility level, these guidelines are intended to enable hospital administrators,
clinical managers, doctors, nurses and allied professionals across the country to
practise IPC and develop their own policies and standard operating procedures
(SOPs).
The IPC methods and practice presented in these guidelines aim to control the
development of AMR and prevent the spread of resistant organisms in HCFs. An
important purpose of these guidelines is to serve as a resource for the development
of training programmes, training modules and IEC (information, education and
communication) materials for all levels of healthcare staff, as well as for patients as
partners in care.
These are relevant for both private as well as public sector HCFs. Although the
principal focus is on secondary and tertiary HCFs, the principles and practice of IPC
are common to all healthcare settings and with suitable adaptation can be applied
to primary care and community health centres.
At the national level, this document can serve as guidance to policy-makers
responsible for developing and monitoring IPC activities in various national
programmes, establishing HAI surveillance and framing national action plans
for IPC and AMR. It is also relevant for national and facility level healthcare
quality managers, regulatory and accreditation bodies, academic institutions and
professional societies.
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are neither present nor incubating at the
time of admission of a patient to the healthcare facility (HCF). The majority of HAIs
manifest after 48 hours of admission.
HAIs should be identified on the basis of both clinical as well as laboratory criteria.
Infection acquired in the hospital but not evident until after discharge is also
considered as HAI. Infection in a newborn in a health facility may also be considered
as HAI. It is important to understand the mode of transmission of disease in an HCF
so that appropriate measures can be taken to control the spread of infection. Figure
2.1 shows the chain of infection.
A variety of microorganisms – including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites – can
either colonize or cause infection, depending on the susceptibility of the host. The
ability of a microorganism to invade, establish and multiply in the cells and tissues
of a host and produce signs and symptoms of disease depends upon the following
factors.

6 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Agent
The microorganism capable of causing the infection is known as the infective agent.
Infective agents include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, helminths and prions.
The ability of a microorganism to cause infection depends upon its ability to invade,
proficiency in overcoming the host defences, its pathogenicity, degree of virulence,
and the infectious dose. Equally important is the agent’s capability to survive in the
environment, and its resistance to antimicrobials.
Reservoir
A reservoir is the source of the infectious agent where it lives and multiplies. These
can be animate (humans, animals) or inanimate (the environment, contaminated
food and water).
Human reservoirs can be symptomatic (exhibiting signs and symptoms of the
disease) or asymptomatic (without signs and symptoms) or they can be carriers
(presence of organisms for varying periods without signs or symptoms).
Asymptomatic cases and carriers are more likely to transmit the disease as
precautions may not be taken since it is not known that the person is harbouring
the organisms. Thus, standard precautions should be taken in all situations while
dealing with patients even when the diagnosis is not known.
Portal of exit
Portals of exit are necessary for the organism to exit the body of one person and be
transmitted to another person. The portal of exit can be the excretions/secretions of
the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, genital tract, blood or any other body fluid.
Modes of transmission
This is the way an agent is transmitted from a reservoir to a susceptible host.
Transmission can occur by:
x Portal of contact – direct contact through hands or indirectly through an
inanimate object;
x Droplets – large-sized droplets released by sneezing, coughing or even talking;
x Airborne route – through very small particles which can travel from room to
room via air currents;
x Common vehicle – where a contaminated vehicle serves as the means of
spreading infection to several persons such as food in a salmonella epidemic
or blood in a blood-borne epidemic (hepatitis B); and
Fundamentals of healthcare-associated infections 7
x Inoculation – a percutaneous injury with a contaminated needle or other sharp
resulting in direct inoculation of the organism into the bloodstream.
Portal of entry
Similar to the portal of exit, it is the site of entry of the organism into the body such
as the mucous membrane of the respiratory, genital, gastrointestinal or urinary
tract, conjunctiva and skin.
Susceptible host
A susceptible host is a person who is susceptible to the infection or lacking in
resistance to the infective organism. Host factors that influence susceptibility to
infection are:
x Age – individuals at extremes of age are more susceptible to infection, e.g.
neonates and old people;
x Socioeconomic status such as health literacy, nutritional status;
x Comorbidities such as diabetes, cancer;
x Immunization status;
x Medications such as immunosuppressive agents and chemotherapeutic agents
x Pregnancy;
x Interventions and devices – surgery, intubation, mechanical ventilation, urinary
catheterization, vascular catheterization;
x Host factors – related to the host that prevent the entry and establishment of
infective agents including:
R endogenous organisms inhabiting body sites such as the gastrointestinal
tract, skin, respiratory tract, genital tract that prevent the establishment of
pathogenic organisms at that site;
R natural antibodies;
R natural barriers such as intact skin, mucous membranes, fascial planes,
cough reflex and gastric acid secretion.
Colonization and infection
Colonization refers to the presence of organisms in the body without causing any
cellular damage or any response on the part of the host. Infection occurs when
the organism causes cellular damage and a host response. Colonization with one
organism may prevent the establishment of another more virulent organism at that
body site. Colonizing organisms can be a part of the normal flora for a particular
body site but cause infection at another body site, for example, E. coli is a normal
flora of the intestinal tract but it can cause infection in the urinary tract.
8 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Removal of the normal flora can cause abnormal organisms to colonize a body
site, e.g. antibiotics kill organisms such as drug-sensitive E. coli and allow drug-
resistant organisms to colonize. Colonization can precede infection if the host
defences are altered or impaired in some way, which can happen if the patient
is on immunosuppressive drugs, has undergone surgery or interventions such as
catheterization and intubation.
Types of healthcare-associated infections
Some common types of HAIs are:
x Bloodstream infection (Box 2.1)
x Urinary tract infection
x Pneumonia
x Surgical-site infection
x Gastrointestinal infection
Box 2.1. Common organisms causing bloodstream infections
Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp.,
Salmonellaspp.,Candidaspp.,Pseudomonasspp.,Corynebacteriaspp.,Acinetobacter
spp., Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CNS)
Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections
Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections are serious infections that
can be associated with high mortality, which may be more than 50% for some
microorganisms. These infections are often associated with intravascular catheters.
Infection can occur at the entry site of the catheter or along the subcutaneous tract
of the catheter (line), known as tunnel infection. This type of infection is largely
dependent on the care taken during insertion and handling of the intravascular
catheter. The duration for which catheters are in place is also important. Both
central and peripheral lines can be a source of infection.
(For the definition criteria of catheter-related bloodstream infections, see Chapter 7
on surveillance of HAI and Chapter 6 on bloodstream infections in the ICU.)
Diagnosis is made by blood culture and semi-quantitative culture of the catheter tip
and catheter lumen.
Healthcare-associated pneumonia
Pneumonia is one of the most serious of HAIs. Ventilator-associated pneumonia
Fundamentals of healthcare-associated infections 9
(VAP) is the most important infection in patients on ventilators in intensive care units.
It has a high case fatality rate and is often associated with serious comorbidities.
It is defined as a lower respiratory tract infection that appears during or after
hospitalization of a patient who was not incubating the infection on admission.The
diagnostic criteria are:
x Fever;
x Cough with purulent sputum;
x New infiltrate on radiology; and
x Gram-staining of sputum/ET aspirate and bacteria.
Healthcare-associated pneumonia is acquired by the inhalation of respiratory
droplets or aerosols, or aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal and gastric
secretions in conditions of low gastric acidity. Infection can also be acquired through
the oropharynx during suction procedures, due to inadequate hand washing and
inappropriate disinfection of respiratory devices.
Risk factors
x Age: very young or very old
x Coronary bypass surgery
x Abdominal surgery
x Existing pulmonary, neurological disease
x Decreased clearance of respiratory secretions due to coma, sedation, etc.
x Invasive devices bypassing natural defences as in mechanical ventilation,
intubation, tracheostomy, enteral feeding
x Medications such as antibiotics, antacids, immunosuppressive agents and
chemotherapy
Urinary tract infection
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common and account for 35–45% of
all HAIs.26,27
The majority of these infections are associated with the use of an
indwelling urinary catheter.
Diagnosis is based on the clinical symptoms of fever, suprapubic tenderness,
frequency of urination and dysuria along with the presence of bacteria in the urine in
significant quantity. The urine culture of the patient shows no more than two species
of organisms identified, at least one of which is a bacterium of t105
CFU/ml.28
The
presence of an indwelling catheter in the urinary tract may give rise to bacteriuria
or mild infection or may even result in severe infections such as pyelonephritis and
septicaemia. The source of organisms can be the patient’s own flora (endogenous
10 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
infection) or exogenous through the hands of staff or contaminated instruments
(Box 2.2). Contamination of the drainage bag and retrograde flow of contaminated
urine into the bladder can also cause UTI.
It is important that the urine specimen for culture be collected using aseptic
precautions.29
The urine specimen should be obtained aseptically from a sample
port in the catheter tubing or by aseptic aspiration of the tubing. For non-catheterized
patients, a clean voided specimen is acceptable. Catheter tips and specimen from
the urine bag should not be cultured.
Box 2.2. Common organisms causing UTI
E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Enterococci spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Serratia marcescens, Candida spp., Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis
Risk factors
x Indwelling urinary catheter
x Instrumentation of the urinary tract
x Poor aseptic preparation during insertion of catheter
x Poor catheter maintenance
x Advanced age
x Female gender
x Severe underlying illness
Surgical-site infection
This is the infection of the site of surgery, earlier called wound infection. The
incidence of surgical-site infections (SSIs) varies from 0.5% to 15% depending
on the type of operation and underlying status of the patient. The main risk factor
is the extent of contamination during the procedure (clean, clean contaminated,
contaminated, dirty), which is largely dependent on the site of surgery, length of the
operation, and the patient’s general condition.
SSI usually occurs within 30 days of the operative procedure. In some types of
surgery, infection can appear even after 30 days of the operation. Since infection
may occur late, all deep infections related to the operative site and to the implant
within 1 year of an operation should be considered postoperative infections.30
(For
details and surveillance definitions see Chapter 7.)
SSI can be superficial, incisional, deep incisional or organ/space.
Fundamentals of healthcare-associated infections 11
x Superficial SSI
R Drainage of pus from the superficial incision
R Pain, tenderness, localized swelling, redness or heat
x Deep/organ space SSI
R Infection appears within 30 days of the procedure or within one year in
the case of an implant or foreign body such as prosthetic heart valve, joint
prosthesis
R Pus discharge from deep incision
R Spontaneous dehiscence or “gaping” of wound
R Fever >38qC, localized pain or tenderness
Specimens for culture include pus, wound swabs, drainage fluid and exudate
(Box 2.3).
Box 2.3. Common organisms causing SSIs
Staph. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas spp.,
anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp.
Risk factors
The non-modifiable variables include age and gender. A systematic review of 57
studies from both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) identified the following factors associated with an increased risk of SSI in
adjusted analysis.31
x High body mass index
x Severity score classification of wound
x Diabetes
x Prolonged duration of surgery
The following are other potential factors that can be improved to increase the
likelihood of a positive surgical outcome.
x Nutritional status
x Cessation of tobacco use
x Correct use of surgical prophylaxis
x Intraoperative technique
Other potential sites of infection
x Skin and soft tissue
x Brain and meninges
12 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Eye and ear (sinusitis, conjunctivitis)
x Reproductive organs (endometrial and other infections following childbirth)
Gastrointestinal infections
These are common infections in paediatric wards and in the community. Introduced
in the hospital through an infected patient, such infections can spread rapidly in
the paediatric unit through contaminated environment, toilets and inadequate hand
washing.
Infectious diarrhoea is confirmed when a bacterial or viral aetiology is demonstrated.
Diarrhoea may also occur due to non-infectious causes such as medications. In
many cases the cause of diarrhoea cannot be diagnosed (for definition criteria, see
Chapter 7).
The infection is transmitted through the faeco-oral route. It may be acquired from
contaminated food or water, infected patients or staff, contact with environment
contaminated with organisms or instruments entering the alimentary tract such as
endoscopes. Box 2.4 gives some common organisms that cause gastrointestinal
infections.
Healthcare-associated diarrhoea often presents as an outbreak. The index case
or asymptomatic carrier introduces the infection in the ward which then leads to
person-to-person spread.
Box 2.4. Common organisms causing gastrointestinal infections
Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium difficile, E. coli,
Aeromonas and Plesiomonas spp., Vibrio spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia,
Entamoeba histolytica, Rotavirus, Norwalk (Noro) and similar viruses (e.g. Astrovirus),
Adenoviruses
Risk factors
x Extremes of age, achlorhydria, antibiotic therapy oral or systemic, decrease in
normal flora, overgrowth of resistant or sensitive pathogens, gastrointestinal
procedures such as insertion of nasogastric tube, endoscopy
x Factors conducive to person-to-person spread such as overcrowding of unit,
understaffing, inadequate hand washing facilities
Fundamentals of healthcare-associated infections 13
Routes of transmission
Contact transmission
Contact is the most common mode of transmission, and usually involves
transmission by touch or via contact with blood or body fluids or secretions. Contact
may be direct or indirect.
x Direct transmission occurs when infectious agents are transferred from
one person to another, e.g. a patient’s blood entering a healthcare worker’s
(HCW’s) body through an unprotected cut in the skin.
x Indirect transmission involves the transfer of an infectious agent through a
contaminated intermediate object or person, e.g. a HCW’s hands transmitting
infectious agents after touching an infected body site on one patient without
performing hand hygiene before touching another patient, or an HCW coming
into contact with fomites (e.g. bedding) or faeces and then with a patient.
Examples of infectious agents transmitted by contact include MDROs such as
methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Gram-
negative bacteria, C. difficile, Norovirus, Ebola virus, HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses,
and highly contagious skin infections/infestations (e.g. impetigo, scabies), etc.
Droplet transmission
Droplet transmission occurs when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks,
or during certain procedures. Droplets are infectious particles >5 microns in size.
The droplet distribution range is limited by the force of expulsion and gravity and is
usually <1 metre.25
Droplets can also be transmitted indirectly to mucosal surfaces
(e.g. via hands). Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via droplets
include influenza virus, Bordetella pertussis and meningococcus.
Airborne transmission
Airborne dissemination may occur via particles containing infectious agents that
remain suspended in air over time and distance. Small-particle aerosols (<5 microns)
are created during breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing and secondarily by
evaporation of larger droplets in conditions of low humidity.
Certain procedures, particularly those that induce coughing, can promote airborne
transmission. These include diagnostic sputum induction, bronchoscopy, airway
suctioning, endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation via facemask and
high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
14 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Aerosols containing infectious agents can be dispersed over long distances by air
currents (e.g. ventilation or air-conditioning systems) and inhaled by susceptible
individuals who have not had any contact with the infectious person. Examples of
infectious agents that are transmitted via the airborne route include measles virus,
chickenpox (varicella) virus and M. tuberculosis.
Vector-borne transmission
Vector-borne transmission refers to transmission of microorganisms by vectors such
as mosquitoes and can be prevented by appropriate construction and maintenance
of an HCF, having closed or screened windows, and proper housekeeping.
Examples of vector-borne diseases include malaria, dengue and chikungunya.
Basic concepts of prevention of HAI
HAIs can be prevented by breaking the epidemiological triad. The most effective
way to prevent HAI is by introducing a barrier between the susceptible host and
the infecting organism. Most HAIs can be prevented through readily available and
relatively inexpensive strategies such as compliance with recommended infection
prevention practices such as:
x Hand hygiene (see Chapter 4)
x Appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (see Chapter 4)
x Following aseptic techniques stringently (see Chapters 4 and 6)
x Paying attention to established practices for cleaning and decontamination of
soiled instruments, followed by either sterilization or high-level disinfection (see
Chapter 4)
x Appropriate disposal of biomedical waste (BMW) (see Chapter 5)
x Appropriate cleaning and disinfection of the environment (see Chapter 5)
x Improving safety in operating rooms and other high-risk areas where the
most vulnerable patients are housed and there is a high risk of exposure to
infectious agents (see Chapter 6)
x Maintaining a safe working environment and safe work practice (see Chapters
4 and 8)
Bundle approach for prevention and control of HAI
Carebundlesincludeasetofevidence-basedmeasuresthatneedtobeimplemented
together, to show a significant improvement in patient care. Together they have
a greater effect on the outcome than the isolated implementation of individual
Fundamentals of healthcare-associated infections 15
measures. Adherence to bundles helps to deliver consistent and reliable patient
care. Care bundles that have shown significant impact on the prevention of HAI
include sets of bundles for the prevention of central line-associated bloodstream
infections (CLABSIs), bundle for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract
infections (CAUTIs), bundle for the prevention of VAP, and bundle for the prevention
of SSIs.
Bundles need to be simple, clear and precise so that they can be followed easily
and appropriately. The measures included in a bundle also have to be adapted to
the local setting and suited to the patient care culture of the hospital. Adherence to
the bundle should be recorded and evaluated to ensure compliance by all members
of the involved healthcare team.
For details of bundles for the prevention of specific types of HAI, see Chapter 6.
IPC and quality standards of healthcare are essential for the well-being and safety
of patients, their families, health workers and the community. A well-organized IPC
programme is a basic requirement in every HCF to assist HCWs in the provision of
quality healthcare.
In 2016, WHO issued evidence-based guidelines incorporated in an implementation
manual on the core components of IPC. The first step towards implementation is
the establishment of an IPC programme at the HCF level.18
Objectives of the IPC programme
The objective is to minimize the risk of HAIs to patients, HCWs and visitors. This is
achieved by:
x enabling and assisting all categories of HCWs to adhere to comprehensive IPC
practices at all levels of care; and
x providing safe and quality healthcare and improving outcomes by reducing
morbidity and mortality.
Structure of IPC programme
The head of the HCF or lead administrator should establish a hospital infection
control committee (HICC) with well-defined composition, roles and responsibilities;
and provide adequate resources for the effective functioning of the IPC
programme.32
Hospital infection control committee
The HICC is an integral component of the IPC programme of the HCF. It is
responsible for establishing and maintaining the IPC programme and its various
functions of monitoring, surveillance, reporting, research and education. The HICC

sterilizers, and epidemiologically investigating outbreaks including the typing of
organisms to detect the source, reservoirs and transmission of infection.
The laboratory should watch for clusters of pathogens that may indicate an outbreak,
the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, and the isolation of highly infectious,
unusual or virulent pathogens. These unusual events or trends must be reported early
to the HICC.
Environmental cultures
The microbiology laboratory must not conduct random, undirected microbiological
sampling of air, water and environmental surfaces in HCFs. Such culturing must
be coordinated with the IPC programme to ensure that it is performed only when
indicated and that the specimens are processed appropriately.
Environmental cultures, including personnel cultures, should be done only when
clear epidemiological evidence indicates an environmental source of the pathogen.
Microbiological sampling and testing of the environment should follow existing
standards.34
Storage of isolates of epidemiological importance
In collaboration with the IPC programme, the laboratory should develop a system
for storing epidemiologically important strains of HAI pathogens. The collection
should be reviewed frequently, and isolates should be discarded when no longer
needed.
Doctors
Physicians and surgeons have a natural leadership role in the HCF and in the
community, especially in infection control.

for waste management should be in compliance with environmental protection
rules, and the Biomedical Waste Management and Handling rules, 2016 and 2018,
and the Kayakalp programme. The housekeeping service manager, in collaboration
with the IPC team, should develop a manual for all housekeeping procedures. The
manual should be reviewed by the HICC and updated regularly.
Responsibilities of the housekeeping services manager
x Identify the varying needs for cleaning in different hospital areas.
x Implement the appropriate cleaning techniques as defined in the policy.
x Organize the collection, transport (treatment and disposal) of different types of
waste according to the waste management policy.
26 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Ensure availability of soap and towel at all times.
x Inform the maintenance service of any building problems requiring repair.
x Organize pest control in the facility.
x Provide appropriate training for all new housekeeping staff and, periodically,
for other employees, and specific training when a new technique is introduced.
Training should stress on personal hygiene and adherence to SOPs.
x Report to the concerned authority if any cleaning staff has illness of respiratory
tract, digestive tract or skin infection including wounds and cuts.
Facility/building maintenance committee/agency
Responsibilities of the maintenance manager
x Ensure regular building maintenance including plumbing, heating, refrigeration
equipment, electrical fittings, heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems
(HVAC) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters; and record-keeping of
the same.
x Collaborate with the HICC, housekeeping, nursing staff or other appropriate
groups in selecting equipment and ensuring their uninterrupted operation.
x Ensure environmental safety of the community from hospital activities such as
waste disposal and protection of water sources.
Additional duties
x Participate in the choice of equipment, if maintenance of the equipment
requires technical assistance.
x Inspect, clean and regularly replace filters of all appliances for ventilation and
humidifiers; records to be shared with the HICC.
x Regularly inspect all surfaces of walls, floors, ceilings to ensure they are kept
smooth and washable and monitor repairs of any opening or crack in partition
walls or window frames.
Infection prevention and control manual
The IPC manual at the facility level should be developed by the IPC team, based on
the IPC policy (as defined by the HICC) with inputs from the relevant departments
followed by review and approval by the HICC. These national guidelines should
from the basis of the IPC manual and can be adapted according to local conditions,
type of facility, services provided, infrastructure and availability of human resources.
The IPC manual should be widely distributed in the HCF and should be available
in all relevant areas. The training programmes for all level of staff should be based
Infection prevention and control programme 27
on procedures and practices described in the IPC manual. It should be regularly
reviewed and updated, preferably annually.
The IPC manual should include the following facility-specific protocols, policies,
guidelines, SOPs and recommendations.
x IPC practices
x Control of environment
x Surveillance of HAIs and management of outbreaks
x Guidelines for IPC in special areas/situations (depending upon the services
provided by the facility)
x Preventing infections among HCWs
x Monitoring and evaluation
Antimicrobial use and management
Appropriate antimicrobial use and management is an integral part of the IPC
programme. Every HCF should establish an antimicrobial stewardship programme
(AMSP), which aims to facilitate the establishment of effective and rational antibiotic
use.36
Antimicrobial stewardship includes the appropriate selection, dosing, route of
administration, and duration of antimicrobial therapy to provide quality patient care,
reduce AMR, and prevent development and transmission of MDRO.
Appropriate antimicrobial use may be achieved through the following:
x Formulate standard treatment guidelines (STGs)37
or hospital antibiotic policy
with a multidisciplinary approach using the local antibiogram.
x Provide ongoing education on rational use of antibiotics to clinicians and
ensuring implementation of antibiotic policies.
x Restrict use of selected antibiotics.
x Before initiating antibiotic treatment, submit appropriate specimens for
bacteriological examination to the laboratory and select an antibiotic based on
the clinical spectrum of disease, sensitivity pattern, patient tolerance and cost.
x Based on culture results, use an agent with as narrow a spectrum as possible
with appropriate dosage, frequency, administration time and duration of
antimicrobial therapy.
x Discontinue antimicrobial therapy based on predefined criteria.
x Monitor surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial use.
x Carry out periodic prescription audits.
x Create hospital formulary through pharmacy and revise periodically.
x Develop strategic interventions through a collaborative approach to improve
28 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
infection control and rational antibiotic use.
x Use antimicrobial prophylaxis only when the benefits outweigh the risks.
Some indications are: selected surgical prophylaxis, prophylaxis of bacterial
endocarditis. Note that antibiotic prophylaxis is not a substitute for appropriate
aseptic surgical technique and other infection control measures.
Role of the microbiology laboratory
The microbiology laboratory has a major role in the containment of AMR, which
include:
x Performing antibiotic susceptibility testing of significant microbial isolates as
per SOPs, including the antimicrobials to be tested and following cascade
reporting;
x Supporting the AMSP committee/drugs and therapeutic committee;
x Monitoring and reporting trends in prevalence of bacterial resistance to
antimicrobial agents in a hospital antibiogram; and
x Providing microbiological support for IPC (role of microbiology laboratory in
IPC) including prompt notification to the IPC team of any unusual AMR patterns
in organisms isolated from relevant clinical specimens.
Specimen collection and transportation
Poor specimen collection and transportation is a major cause for wrong diagnosis
and over-consumption of antibiotics. The following measures must be taken:
x Microbiologists must train nurses and phlebotomists to collect specimens
properly and transport them rapidly to the laboratory. This requires the support
of the hospital administration. Microbiologists must do periodic audits to give a
feedback to the chief of nursing, head of laboratory and quality manager.
x Microbiology laboratories must follow strict sample rejection criteria for
inappropriately collected samples, e.g. respiratory samples contaminated with
saliva/oral secretions are inappropriate and must be rejected.
x Urine samples contaminated with vaginal or urethral commensal flora should
be rejected. Only mid-stream urine (MSU) samples should be accepted.
x For clinical reporting the microbiology laboratory should report only significant
pathogens (not colonizers and contaminants). Clinicians should correlate
laboratory reports clinically before starting treatment.
x The laboratory should communicate results to the clinicians at the earliest.
Role of biomarkers in infections
x Biomarkers play a useful role in the managements of infections.38
Use
Infection prevention and control programme 29
biomarkers and point-of-care tests if feasible and cost-effective, and interpret in
the clinical context.
x C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) are useful biomarkers that
are often used in the management of infections, especially in children under-5
years and critically ill patients.39
x Elevated serum lactate levels (>2.0 mmol/L) are a good risk stratification for
mortality. Serial levels correlate with septic shock and multiorgan failure. This
test is generally available as part of the routine arterial blood gas analysis done
in ICUs.
x Absolute polymorphonuclear (PMN) count, immature vs mature PMN (shift to
the left) and toxic granules in neutrophils in peripheral smear are relatively low-
cost methods to detect sepsis, but need trained human resources.
Educational programmes and strategies
x Appropriate educational material on IPC should be made available to all
HCWs, patients and visitors.
x Continuing educational interactive programmes and awareness drives should
be conducted periodically.
x Awareness programmes should be organized on the prevention and control of
specific infectious diseases for different levels of staff of the HCF and for the
community.
Risk assessment and risk management
A risk-based approach should be used in formulating the annual action plan.
Procedures and processes associated with risk of infection to patient and staff
should be evaluated to assess the risk in the HCF (Table 3.1). The general approach
to risk assessment and risk management (RA-RM) is as follows:
x The system for RA-RM needs to be divided into individual functional, structural
and operational components.
x The hypothetical frequency of occurrence of a given event needs to be semi-
quantified, e.g. unlikely, extremely rare, infrequent, frequent or imminent.
x Semi-quantification of the magnitude of impact of a given event needs to be
done, e.g. mild, moderate, severe or catastrophic.
x The scales used in the semi-quantification of the frequency of occurrence and
magnitude of impact are arbitrary and generally are 3-point or 5-point scales.
x The annual IPC implementation plan of an HCF should be based on the

Planning, monitoring, audit and feedback
Based on the risk assessment, an annual plan of action should be charted out at
the end of the current year and ratified by the HICC. Targets to be achieved on the
lines of aims and objectives of the programme and strategies to be implemented to
achieve these should be emphasized.
The main purpose of audit/ monitoring practices and feedback is to achieve
behavioural change or other process modifications to improve the quality of care
and practices with aims of reducing risk of HAI and spread of AMR.
Regular monitoring/audit of IPC practices and feedback (individual/team/unit) is
effective to increase adherence to IPC practices. Examples of indicators include:
x Compliance with processes such as hand hygiene, checklists, care bundles;
x Results of knowledge attitude and practice (KAP) studies to indicate behaviour
change;
x Compliance with rules and regulations such as the BMW management rules;
and
x HAI rates obtained through the surveillance system.
Implementation strategies
WHO recommends a multimodal strategy for IPC activities to improve practices and
reduce HAI and AMR.11
The multimodal approach consists of three or more components implemented in an
integrated way with the aim of improving outcomes (bundle approach), and includes
tools (bundles and checklist) developed by multidisciplinary teams based on local
conditions. An example of an effective multimodal strategy, which has shown to
bring about significant improvement in IPC practices and reduce the risk of HAI.40
x System change with appropriate infrastructures and supplies to enable IPC practice
x Education and training of relevant staff
32 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Monitoring of the infrastructure, practices, processes, outcomes and providing
feedback
x Reminders in the workplace and communication
x Culture change within the establishment and strengthening safety climate
Box 3.1 summarizes the prerequisites for an effective IPC programme.
Evaluation and feedback of the programme
x Evalute the IPC programme periodically to assess the extent to which the
objectives have been met.
x Ascertain whether the activities are being performed in accordance with the
requirements.
x Identify aspects that need improvement.
Evaluation can be done using indicators, e.g.
x Process indicators: compliance with hand hygiene, care bundles;
x Outcome indicators: HAI rates, mortality and morbidity.
The results of the evaluation should be shared with the HICC.
Box 3.1. Prerequisites for an effective IPC programme
x Policies and guidelines including best practices and standard operating
procedures (SOPs)
x Adequately trained and motivated human resources
x Continuous and adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE)
x Antimicrobial use policy and links with the antimicrobial stewardship programme
(AMSP)
x Integration with activities of the quality and safety department
x HAI surveillance and outbreak investigation
x Microbiology laboratory support
x Environmental protection
x Links with other patient safety programmes in the healthcare facility (HCF)
x Evaluation of the programme activities: monitoring and feedback
x Budget allocation for all the above
x Implementation through a multimodal approach
A two-tiered approach to precautions is used to interrupt the mode of transmission
of infectious agents.
x Standard precautions: these refer to work practices that are applied to
all patients receiving care in health facilities, regardless of their diagnosis
or presumed infectious status so as to minimize the risk of transmission of
infectious agents in all situations. Standard precautions minimize the likelihood
of transmission of infectious agents between HCWs and patients, and from
patient to patient.
x Transmission-based precautions: Transmission-based precautions are
precautions required to be taken based on the route of transmission of
organisms like contact precautions, airborne precautions, etc.
If successfully implemented, standard and transmission-based precautions prevent
any infection from being transmitted. IPC precautions pending confirmation of
diagnosis are given in Annex 2.
Standard precautions
The use of standard precautions is the primary strategy for minimizing the risk of
transmission of microorganisms in healthcare facilities.
Standard precautions are to be followed for all patients, irrespective of their infection
status. These are to be used to avoid contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and
excretions regardless of whether contaminated grossly with blood or not; non-intact
skin; and mucous membrane. The key components of standard precautions are:41

d. Waste disposal
1. Hand hygiene
The WHO guidelines on hand hygiene in healthcare (2009) suggest that42
hand
hygiene is the single most important measure for prevention of infection. Hands
can become contaminated with infectious agents through contact with a patient,
patient surroundings, the environment, or other HCWs. Hand hygiene removes
dust/soil, organic material and transient microorganisms from the skin and reduces
the risk of cross-contamination. Evidence suggests that the hands of the HCWs are
the most common vehicle for the transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens
from patient to patient and within the healthcare environment (Box 4.1). Studies
show a direct correlation between an increase in adherence to hand hygiene with
decrease in HAIs.
Box 4.1. Hand decontamination
x Routine hand hygiene
R Hand washing with soap and water is preferred when hands are visibly dirty or
soiled with blood or other body fluids or after using the toilet.
R Hand rubbing with an alcohol-based preparation is the preferred method for
routine hygienic antisepsis if hands are not visibly soiled.
x Surgical hand scrub
Hand washing with soap and water
Indications: when there is visibly heavy contamination, e.g. with proteinaceous
material, blood or body fluids (Fig. 4.1).
x After attending to a patient with suspected/confirmed C. difficile infection
x After using toilet
x Before and after having food
x Adequate number of sinks with running water and soap should be available in
the haemodialysis unit to facilitate hand washing.

Surgical hand scrub
Hand scrubbing with an antiseptic agent before beginning a surgical procedure
reduces the number of microorganisms, and inhibits the growth of microorganisms
on hands under the gloves. Chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine-containing soaps
are the most commonly used products for surgical hand scrub. The antimicrobial
efficacy of alcohol-based formulations is superior to that of all other currently
available methods of preoperative surgical hand preparation.46
Improving the implementation of hand hygiene
Hand hygiene can be improved through a multimodal strategy suggested by WHO.47
The key components are:
x System change: ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place to allow
HCWs to practise hand hygiene. This has two essential elements:
R Access to a safe, continuous water supply as well as to soap and towels;
R Readily accessible alcohol-based hand rub at the point of care.
x Training/education: providing regular training on the importance of hand
hygiene, based on the “My 5 moments for hand hygiene” approach (Fig. 4.3),
and the correct steps for hand rubbing and handwashing, to all HCWs.
x Evaluation and feedback: monitoring hand hygiene practices and
infrastructure, along with related perceptions and knowledge among HCWs,
while providing performance and results feedback to staff.
x Reminders at the workplace: prompting and reminding HCWs about the
importance of hand hygiene and about the appropriate indications and
procedures for performing it.
x Institutional safety climate: creating an environment and perceptions that
facilitate raising awareness about patient safety issues while guaranteeing
improvement of hand hygiene as a high priority at all levels, including
R active participation at both the institutional and individual levels;
R awareness of individual and institutional capacity to change and improve
(self-efficacy); and
R partnership with patients and patient organizations.
38 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
The WHO hand hygiene direct observation audit tool is given in Annex 3. HCFs
may adapt and use this tool locally for hand hygiene audits.48
2. Personal protective equipment
Personal protective equipment (PPE) refers to physical barriers, which are used
alone or in combination, to protect mucous membranes, airways, skin and clothing
from contact with infectious agents. PPE should be used by:
x HCWs who provide direct care to patients and who may come in contact with
blood, body fluids, excretions, and secretions;
x Support staff including cleaners, and laundry staff in situations where they may
have contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions.
x Laboratory staff, who handle patient specimens;
x Family members who provide care to patients and are in a situation where they
may have contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions;
x HCWs in a haemodialysis unit, because of the high risk of transmission
of blood-borne infections during the various activities associated with
haemodialysis and handling of equipment; and

PPE includes gloves, aprons and gowns, facial protection, footwear and hair cover
or cap.
Gloves49
x Gloves should be worn as an additional measure, not as a substitute for
handwashing.
x Gloves are not required for routine care activities in which contact is limited to a
patient’s intact skin.
x Wear gloves when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous
membranes, non-intact skin.
x Change gloves between tasks and procedures on the same patient after
contact with potentially infectious material.
x If gloves become torn or heavily soiled and additional patient care tasks must
be performed, then change them before starting the next task.
x Remove gloves immediately after completion of care or a specified task, at
point of use before touching non-contaminated items and clean environmental
surfaces and before moving to another patient or using a mobile phone.
x Perform hand hygiene immediately after removing gloves.
Types and indications for wearing gloves
There are three types of gloves:
1. Clean, non-sterile gloves should be worn:
x For examinations and non-surgical procedures;
x For handling items visibly soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions or
excretions when the HCW has open skin lesions on the hands; and
x When the HCW has non-intact skin on the hands.
2. Sterile, single-use gloves should be used for aseptic procedures.
3. Heavy duty/utility gloves should be used for decontamination of large
equipment, cleaning of floors, walls, HCF furniture such as beds, etc. These
gloves can be reused after cleaning.
Gloves in haemodialysis units
1. Clean disposable gloves should be available for routine use.
2. Gloves must be worn in haemodialysis facilities whenever caring for a patient
or touching the patient’s medical equipment, handling lab specimens or used
40 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
dialysers, cleaning machines, cleaning stations, and wiping up blood or other
body fluid spills.
3. They must be changed whenever moving from one patient or machine to
another.
4. They must be changed after cannulation.
5. Sterile gloves must be available and used during procedures requiring aseptic
technique such as central line insertion.
6. Remove gloves after caring for a patient. Do not wear the same gloves for
the care of more than one patient, and do not wash gloves between use with
different patients.
7. Perform hand hygiene after removing gloves.

Procedures and practices for IPC 41
Aprons and gowns
International guidelines recommend that protective clothing (apron or gown) should
be worn by all HCWs when:
x there is close contact with the patient, materials or equipment that may lead to
contamination of skin, uniforms or other clothing with infectious agents; and
x there is a risk of contamination with blood, body substances, secretions or
excretions (except sweat).
The type of apron or gown required depends on the degree of risk, including the
anticipated degree of contact with infectious material and the potential for blood and
body substances to penetrate through to clothes or skin.
x A clean non-sterile apron or gown is generally adequate to protect skin and
prevent soiling of clothing during procedures and/or patient-care activities that
are likely to bring contact with blood, body substances, secretions or excretions
(except sweat).
x A fluid-resistant apron or gown should be worn when procedures are likely to
generate splashing or sprays of blood or body substances and there is a risk
that clothing may become contaminated with blood and body substances.
x Gowns and aprons preferably must be changed between patients.
Table 4.1 gives detailed characteristics of aprons and gowns.
Facial protection
Indications
Usual facial protection includes a medical/surgical mask (triple-layer surgical mask)
and eye protection (face shield or goggles), to protect the conjunctivae and the
mucous membranes of the nose, eyes and mouth during activities that are likely
to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions. Eye
protection should also be used while providing care to patients with respiratory
symptoms such as coughing and sneezing, since sprays of secretions may occur.
Types of facial protection
x Eye protection goggles protect the eyes. These should fit snuggly over and
around eyes and personal prescription glasses – personal glasses are not a
substitute for goggles.
x Face shield – when skin protection, in addition to mouth, nose and eye
protection is needed; for example, when irrigating a wound or suctioning
copious secretions, a face shield can be used as a substitute for a mask or
42 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
goggles. The face shield should cover the forehead, extend below the chin,
and wrap around the side of the face.
x Masks are worn where appropriate to protect the mucous membranes of
the nose and mouth during procedures and patient-care activities likely to
generate droplets and splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions
and excretions. Masks should fully cover nose and mouth and prevent fluid
penetration.Triple-layer surgical masks fitted tightly to the face should be
worn, and discarded immediately after use. If the mask gets wet or dirty with
secretions, it must be changed immediately.

Waste Handling and Management Rules 2016, 2018.
Procedures and practices for IPC 43
A surgical mask becomes ineffective as a barrier if its integrity is damaged or if it
becomes wet (i.e. from perspiration, or if splashed with blood or other potentially
infectious material). If this occurs, remove the mask and replace with another.
Respirators: These protect from inhalation of infectious aerosols (e.g. M.
tuberculosis). Some types are: particulate respirators, half- or full-face elastomeric
respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).50
The most commonly used respirators in healthcare settings are N95 particulate
respirators. The device filters particles more than 0.3 microns in diameter.
Indications for use
Particulate respirators should be used:
x by care-providers of patients with obligate and preferentially airborne-
transmitted diseases such as TB;
x while performing aerosol-generating procedures that have been consistently
associated with increased risk of pathogen transmission;
x if an aerosol-generating procedure such as bronchoscopy is performed on a
patient with active TB; and
x if a particulate respirator is not available, whenever possible, avoid
performance of aerosol-generating procedures associated with an increased
risk of transmission of pathogens in patients with acute respiratory infections.
Training
Ensure that users of particulate respirators receive training on:
x How to put on a particulate respirator (e.g. N95 respirator);
x The need to perform the seal check every time the respirator is worn;
x Avoide contamination during use, and removing and disposing of the
respirator; and
x Changing the mask immediately if the respirator gets wet or dirty with
secretions.
If patients with known or suspected airborne infections (e.g. pulmonary TB) are
cohorted in a common area, and if multiple patients are to be visited sequentially,
it may be advisable to wear a single particulate respirator for the duration of the
activity. This type of use requires that the respirator should not be removed at any
time during the activity, and that the user does not touch the respirator.
44 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Footwear
x A closed footwear, which can be easily cleaned and disinfected, must be used
whenever work processes or environments could cause foot injuries or spillage
of blood or body fluids.
x Personal footwear should be changed when entering clean areas such as OTs,
labour rooms, ICU.
x Shoe covers may be used over street shoes to protect clean areas from soil
and dirt brought in by shoes.
Hair covers
x Long hair must be secured with a rubber band and hair cover worn to protect
the hair and to protect the patient from falling hair.
Selection and safe use of PPE
The type of PPE should be selected on the basis of estimated risk of contamination
of the HCW’s hands, clothing or other areas of the body by blood, body fluid,
excretions or secretions of the patient. The route of transmission of the infectious
agent is an important factor in selecting the PPE.
Although PPE is the most visible control used to prevent transmission of infection,
it must be used in conjunction with administrative and engineering controls. PPE
must be correctly selected and used in a safe manner, and must be available and
accessible to HCWs and visitors.
Ensure sufficient supplies of appropriate PPE
If resources are limited and disposable PPE items are not available, use reusable
items (e.g. cotton gowns) and disinfect properly after each use. To avoid wastage,
critically evaluate situations in which PPE is indicated, and maximize the provision
of clinical care during each entry to the patient's room. However, use disposable
PPE only while handling risk group 4 organisms or infection due to the same.
Before putting on PPE
x HCWs should be trained on the use of PPE as part of the IPC training.
x The training should address the protocols adopted by a specific facility and
include practising both putting on and taking off procedures and performing
care-related activities while wearing PPE.
x The competency of the HCWs in using PPE should be assessed and tested
and, ideally, properly documented.
Procedures and practices for IPC 45
x Adequate resources (human, material and financial) must be made available.
x Management of the resources should include stock management, availability of
different sizes and shapes of PPE, placement of items for easy access, quality
of items purchased and line management for reporting shortages.
x Written protocols should be in place for step-wise procedures in putting on and
taking off PPE, management of used and potentially contaminated PPE and
associated medical devices, including safe discard and decontamination.
x Appropriate spaces should be designated so that PPE can be put on and taken
off in separate areas.
x The use of trained observers to monitor the procedures for putting on and
taking off of PPE correctly is essential.
x PPE use should be restricted to areas where it is necessary and has a specific
purpose.
x Any protective clothing worn by HCWs in an area with high risk of contamination
such as laboratory or OT must be removed when leaving that area.
x Protective clothing or PPE which has been in contact with patients should not
be worn outside the patient-care area.
When putting on PPE
x PPE must be put on in the proper order as it cannot be modified while in the
patient-care area. An observer should check the integrity of the PPE, making
sure it is well adjusted, and write the name and role of the person as well as
the time of entry into the high-risk zone on the apron.
x The sequence of removal of PPE should be in the reverse order of putting on
the PPE. Eye protection should be put on in a way that it can be taken off as
late as possible during the PPE removal process.51
x Information and posters about PPE, demonstrating the sequence for wearing
and removing PPE should be posted in all patient-care areas.
PPE should be put on and taken off in correct sequence and disposed in accordance
with the Biomedical Waste Management and Handing Rules 2016, 2018.
3. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette52
Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette means the measures taken by a person
having signs and symptoms of respiratory infection to contain respiratory secretions
and prevent the transmission of the infection to other persons. The following
measures are recommended:
46 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Cover mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
x Dispose the tissue after use in the nearest waste container.
x Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects or materials.
x If resources permit, HCFs should ensure the availability of materials such as
tissues and foot-operated waste bins for adhering to respiratory hygiene and
cough etiquette in waiting areas for patients and visitors.
x In the absence of handkerchief or tissues, patients should be instructed to
cover their nose and mouth with their arm during coughing and sneezing.
x Provide conveniently located dispensers of ABHR.
x Where sinks are available, ensure that water and soap for hand washing are
available at all times.
x Posters elaborating cough etiquette and hand hygiene must be displayed.
Posters in the local language should be put up at appropriate locations such as
the OPD entrance, emergency department and doctors’ clinics with instructions
for patients and their attendants to inform the healthcare staff if they have
symptoms of respiratory infection and on how to practise respiratory hygiene
and cough etiquette.
The following information must be displayed in patient-care areas for educating
patients, staff and visitors:
x Respiratory infections, such as influenza (flu), whooping cough and severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are spread by cough, sneezing or unclean
hands.
x To help stop the spread of germs:
R Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
R Stay at home when you are sick.
R Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or handkerchief when you cough
or sneeze.
R In the absence of handkerchief or tissues, cover your nose and mouth with
your arm during coughing and sneezing.
R Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not
available, use an ABHR.
R Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
R Practise other good health habits. Clean and disinfect frequently touched
surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill. Get
plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of
fluids and eat nutritious food.
Procedures and practices for IPC 47
4. Prevention of injuries from sharps
Handling sharps
Handling sharps (needles, scalpels, etc.) is one of the most hazardous activities
carried out by HCWs in the course of their duties. Sharps should be handled with
extreme caution to avoid injuries during use, disposal or reprocessing.
x Used needles must not be recapped by hand; if necessary, use the single hand
“scoop” method.
x Used needles should not be bent or broken after use.
x Used sharps should be disposed of immediately in designated puncture-proof
containers (labelled with a biohazard symbol) located in the area where the
items were used, for transport to the incinerator or pit or as per HCF policy for
waste disposal, given in Chapter 5. These containers must not be located in
areas which are easily accessible to the public (see Annex 8.4).
x Sharps should be used only once. A handful of sharp instruments must not be
picked up simultaneously.
x While handling sharps, the sharp end of instruments shall be positioned away
from oneself and others.
x If injured by sharps, contact the ward, clinic or unit supervisor immediately for
further management.
x Sharps should be disposed of in a puncture proof container, as recommended
by BMW guidelines.
5. Safe handling of patient-care equipment
Equipment that has been in contact with a patient should be disinfected or sterilized
as appropriate before use for another patient.
x Equipment that has been soiled with blood or body fluids should be
decontaminated and cleaned to prevent transfer of microorganisms to other
patients and the environment.
x Cleaning of patient-care areas and equipment should be carried out by a
team of dedicated personnel trained in the appropriate cleaning procedures.
Responsibility and accountability for cleaning should be assigned.
x A hospital disinfection policy should be prepared for appropriate cleaning,
disinfection and sterilization of patient-care devices that come in contact with
mucous membranes and access sterile tissues. The policy should be strictly
followed and monitored. Accountability and responsibility should be assigned.
48 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x A new equipment or serviced and repaired equipment should be cleaned and
disinfected before patient use as per hospital policy.
x Heavy duty or strong utility gloves must be worn during decontamination,
cleaning and disinfection of instruments.
x Soiled patient-care equipment should be handled in a manner that prevents
exposure of skin and mucous membranes and contamination of clothing and
environment.
x Disposable patient-care equipment should not be reused and must be
discarded into an appropriate container in accordance with the hospital waste
management policy and the Biomedical Waste Management and Handling
Rules 2016, 2018.
x Patient-care supplies (e.g. lotion, cream, soap) shall not be shared by patients.
Injection safety53
Injection safety is an important component of standard precautions.
Use of injection devices
Practical guidance on the use of injection devices is given below:
x Use a new injection device for each procedure, including for the reconstitution
of a unit of medication or vaccine.
x Inspect the packaging of the injection device to ensure that the protective
barrier has not been breached.
Discard the device if the package has been punctured, torn or damaged by exposure
to moisture, or if the expiry date has passed.
Single-dose and multi-dose vials
x Whenever possible, use a single-dose vial for each patient, to reduce cross-
contamination between patients.
x Open only one vial of a particular medication at a time in each patient-care
area.
x If possible, keep one multi-dose vial for each patient, and store it with the
patient’s name on the vial in a separate treatment or medication room.
x Do not store multi-dose vials in the open ward or general patient-care area,
where they could be inadvertently contaminated.
x Before use, examine the vial for turbidity, particulate matter or discolouration,
and discard if any are present.
x Never leave a needle or cannula inserted into a medication vial via the rubber
stopper.
Procedures and practices for IPC 49
x Discard a multi-dose vial:
R if sterility of contents is compromised;
R if the expiry date or time has passed;
R if found to be without a specific date or time, improperly stored or
contaminated regardless of the expiry date.
x The date of discard from the opening of a multi-dose vial should be decided by
the HICC of the facility. Normally, it is 28 days from the date of opening, even if
it is within the expiry date.
x Single-dose vials for reconstitution should be used instead of fluid or solution
bags for routine injection.
Labelling
After reconstitution of a multi-dose vial, label the final medication container with:
x date and time of preparation;
x final concentration;
x expiry date and time; and
x name and signature of the person reconstituting the drug.
For multi-dose medications that DO NOT require reconstitution, add a label with:
x date and time of first piercing the vial;
x name and signature of the person first piercing the vial.
Injection preparation and administration
Injections should be prepared in a designated clean area where contamination by
blood and body fluids is unlikely.
Practical guidance on preparing injections
The steps to be followed when preparing injections are:54
x Before starting the injection session, and whenever there is contamination with
blood or body fluids, clean the preparation surfaces with 70% alcohol (isopropyl
alcohol or ethanol) and allow to dry.
x Assemble all equipment needed for the injection: sterile single-use needles and
syringes, reconstitution solution such as sterile water or specific diluent, alcohol
swab or cotton wool, sharps container.
x Do not use alcohol skin disinfection for administration of live attenuated
vaccines.
x Do not pre-soak cotton wool in a container as these can become contaminated.
50 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Procedure for septum vials
x Wipe the access diaphragm (septum) with 70% alcohol on a swab before
piercing the vial, and allow to air dry before inserting a device into the bottle.
x Use a sterile syringe and needle for each insertion into a multi-dose vial.
x Never leave a needle in a multi-dose vial.
Practical guidance on administering injections
Aseptic techniques should be followed for all injections.
General
When administering an injection:
x perform hand hygiene;
x wipe the top of the vial with 70% alcohol (isopropyl alcohol or ethanol) using a
swab or cotton-wool ball; and
Box 4.2. Injection safety in haemodialysis units
x Parenteral medications should be prepared in a designated clean area away from
patient-treatment stations.
x Do not carry medication vials, syringes, alcohol swabs, or supplies in pockets. If
trays are used to deliver medications to individual patients, they must be cleaned
between patients.
x Single-dose vials should be dedicated to one patient only and should not be re-
entered.
x Always use a sterile syringe and needle/cannula when entering a vial. Cleanse
the access diaphragm of vials using friction and 70% alcohol. Allow to dry before
inserting a device into the vial.
x Never pool or combine leftover contents of vials for later use.
x Use aseptic technique during all aspects of preparing, handling and administration
of parenteral medication administration, medication vial use, injections, and
glucose monitoring procedures.
x Scrub the hub of intravenous (IV) tubing and medication vials prior to accessing
using friction and 70% alcohol, iodophor, or chlorhexidine/alcohol agent. Allow to
dry prior to accessing.
x Never use infusion supplies such as needles, syringes, flush solutions,
administration sets, or IV fluids on more than one patient. Never use IV solution
containers (e.g. bags or bottles) for the purpose of IV flush solutions (or other
purposes) for more than one patient.
Procedures and practices for IPC 51
x use a sterile syringe and needle, withdraw the medication from the ampoule or
vial.
Reconstitution
x If reconstitution is necessary, withdraw the reconstitution solution from the
ampoule or vial using a sterile syringe, insert the needle into the rubber
septum in the single or multi-dose vial and inject the necessary amount of
reconstitution fluid.
x Remove the needle and syringe and discard them immediately as a single unit
into a sharps container.
x Mix the contents of the vial thoroughly until all visible particles have dissolved.
Needle-free system
x Wipe the rubber septum of the multi-dose vial with an alcohol swab.
x Insert the spike into the multi-dose vial.
x Wipe the port of the needle-free system with an alcohol swab.
x Remove a sterile syringe from its packaging.
x Insert the nozzle of the syringe into the port.
x Withdraw the reconstituted drug.
Delay in administration
x If the dose cannot be administered immediately for any reason, cover the
needle with the cap using a one-hand scoop technique.
x Store the device safely in a dry kidney dish or similar container.
Box 4.3. Don’ts for injection safety
DO NOT:
x allow the needle to touch any contaminated surface;
x reuse a syringe, even if the needle is changed;
x touch the diaphragm after disinfection with 70% alcohol (isopropyl alcohol or
ethanol);
x use the same needle and syringe for several multi-dose vials;
x use the same mixing syringe to reconstitute several vials;
x use bags or bottles of intravenous solution as a common source of supply for
multiple patients (except in pharmacies using laminar flow cabinets);
x use a single loaded syringe to administer medication to several patients (i.e.
ensure one needle, one syringe, one patient!);
x change the needle to reuse the syringe; and
x store leftover medications for later use.
52 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
6. Principles of asepsis
These are discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
7. Environmental infection control
a. Patient placement
Appropriate placement of patients is important in preventing the transmission of
infections in the hospital setting.
General principles
x Spacing between beds
In open plan wards, there should be adequate space between each bed to
reduce the risk of cross-contamination/infection occurring from direct or indirect
contact or droplet transmission. Space between beds should be 1–2 metres.
x Single rooms
Single rooms reduce the risk of transmission of infection from the source
patient to others by reducing direct or indirect contact transmission. Single
rooms should have:
R hand-washing facilities
R toilet and bathroom facilities.
x Anterooms
Single rooms used for isolation purposes may include an anteroom to support
the use of PPE.
Placement with regular admissions
x A room should be cleaned before admitting a patient. There should be a policy
for cleaning the room (i) after patient discharge (terminal cleaning) and (ii)
before admission.
x All patient-care items used by the previous patient should be removed
and replaced with clean items, e.g. bed linen, waterproof covering, oxygen
humidifiers, face mask, etc. as per the housekeeping policy.
x Patient-care equipment and articles should be cleaned, disinfected or sterilized
according to the disinfection policy (see Annex 5.1).
Transport of patients
Movement and transportation of patients from the isolation room or area should be
restricted to essential purposes only. This will reduce the possibility of transmission
of microorganisms in other areas of the HCF.
Annexes 53
Appropriate precautions should be taken during transportation to reduce the risk of
transmission of microorganisms to other patients, HCWs or the hospital environment
(surfaces or equipment).
Infection control precautions during transport of patients55
x It is appropriate to place a surgical mask on the face of a patient with
pulmonary tuberculosis during transit.
x Care should be taken of drainage and shunts and IV lines as these are
potential sources for contamination of the environment, trolleys, etc. during
transportation, also a source of infection for the patient. Closed sterile drainage
is to be maintained at all times. Shunts and IV lines should be covered with
sterile dressing during transportation. A trolley should have the facility for
hanging IV bottles, tying of urine bags below bladder level which helps in
proper draining of urine and prevents stagnation of urine.
x Change trolley cover between patients.
x Spills of blood and body fluid should be taken care of immediately.
x Routine cleaning schedules for trolleys and wheel-chairs should be maintained.
Policy for visitors
The HCF should have a visitors’ policy depending upon the type of services and the
type of patients in the hospital56
(see Annex 6 for “Policy for visitors and attendants”).
b. Environmental cleaning; c. Linen and laundry; d. Waste management
The above three are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.
Box 4.4. Measures to improve adherence to standard precautions
x Staff education in hand hygiene, standard precautions
x Ready access to PPE
x Visual reminders at the patient bedside in the form of posters, along with verbal
reminders from supervising staff
x Bundling of supplies in designated supply carts or pre-organized packs to provide
immediate access to PPE and facilitate their use in resuscitation settings
x Monitoring of adherence through “safety” rounds
• Possible disciplinary action if there are repeated lapses in adherence
54 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Transmission-based precautions
These precautions for aseptic techniques and device management for clinical
procedures are applied in addition to standard precautions, depending upon the
epidemiology and route of transmission of the agent/disease. These precautions
are relevant to high-risk procedures (e.g. use of indwelling catheters and other
devices, surgery, and other invasive procedures) and special settings (e.g. OTs,
ICUs, neonatal wards, haemodialysis units and central reprocessing units). The
following modes of transmission and appropriate transmission-based precautions
should be adopted in HCFs (see Annex 7).
Airborne precautions
The airborne route of infection occurs through droplet nuclei of 1–5 micron that are
disseminated through the air. These droplet nuclei can remain suspended in the air
for varying periods of time and can travel long distances (>1 metre) and from room
to room. Droplet nuclei arise from the drying of suspended droplets carrying the
infectious agent.
Diseases that spread by the airborne route include: pulmonary or laryngeal
tuberculosis, measles, chicken pox, pulmonary plague and viral haemorrhagic
fever with pneumonia. Transmission of droplet nuclei at a short range may occur
with SARS-CoV, human influenza, and other viral respiratory infections, during
performance of aerosol-generating procedures.
Persons caring for patients with airborne infections should take the following
precautions besides those related to patient placement and transport:
x Respiratory protection: persons entering the airborne infection isolation room
should wear a particulate respirator, e.g. a N95 mask with a proper fit.
x Restricted entry: susceptible healthcare personnel should be restricted from
entering the room of patients known or suspected to have airborne infections.
x Immunize susceptible persons: susceptible persons should be immunized
as soon as possible following unprotected contact with vaccine-preventable
infections.
x Protection during aerosol-generating procedures: for aerosol-generating
procedures associated with pathogen transmission, appropriate PPE should
be used in an airborne infection isolation room. N95 masks should be worn
by persons performing aerosol-generating procedures (such as endotracheal
suction and bronchoscopy) on patients with respiratory infections.
Procedures and practices for IPC 55
Droplet precautions
Droplet transmission occurs through large respiratory droplets >5 microns in size.
Transmission occurs when infectious respiratory droplets are expelled by coughing,
sneezing or talking, and come into contact with another person’s mucosa (eyes, nose
or mouth), either directly or via contaminated hands. Since these microorganisms do
not travel over long distances, special air handling and ventilation are not required.
Infections transmitted through droplets include pneumonia, meningitis, group A
streptococcal disease, pertussis, diphtheria and influenza, mumps.
During an influenza pandemic, the circulating human virus is expected to be
transmitted in the same manner as seasonal influenza viruses. Hence droplet
precautions should be applied in addition to standard precautions.
Droplet precautions include:
x Patient placement: keep a minimum of 1–2 metre inter-bed distance.
x Cough etiquette: explain the importance of respiratory hygiene and cough
etiquette to patients.
x Personal protective equipment: wear a triple-layered surgical mask within 1–2
metres of the patient. For practical purposes, it is advisable to use the mask
when entering the patient's room. For aerosol-generating procedures, N95
masks should be used.
x Patient transport: the patient should wear a triple-layered surgical mask.
Contact precautions
Contact transmission of microorganisms during patient care is responsible for the
majority of HAIs in patients and healthcare staff. Contact transmission can be direct
or indirect.
Direct transmission
This occurs when infectious agents are transferred from one person to another
without a contaminated intermediate object or person. For example, blood or other
body substances from an infectious person may come into contact with a mucous
membrane or breaks in the skin of another person.
Indirect transmission
This involves the transfer of an infectious agent through a contaminated intermediate
object (fomite) or person. These include:
56 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x hands of HCWs;
x clothing after care of a patient colonized or infected with an infectious agent,
which can then be transmitted to subsequent patients;
x patient-care devices that are shared between patients without cleaning and
disinfection; and
x environmental surfaces that are inadequately disinfected.
Diseases transmitted through contact
x colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms, enteric infections
and skin infections
x Hand hygiene is important since contact transmission can occur in respiratory
viral infections when respiratory secretions or droplets contaminate surfaces,
which can contaminate hands of HCWs.
Combination of contact, droplet and airborne precautions
Contact, droplet and airborne precautions may be combined for diseases that have
multiple routes of transmission or in case of epidemiologically important organisms,
risk group 4 organisms or where transmission routes are unknown. Combined
precautions are recommended in case of Ebola and Nipah virus disease. They are
always to be used in addition to standard precautions and should be applied to all
suspects, probable and confirmed cases.
Triage and patient placement
A high index of suspicion is needed to identify potentially infectious individuals
(including colonization of MDRO) in order to ensure their safe and timely
placement.57,58
Specific triage policies such as provision of visual alert to remind patient to inform
staff of fever or respiratory symptoms should be developed for early detection and
isolation, so as to minimize transmitting communicable diseases to other patients
and HCWs in the outpatient setting. During triage, the following should be observed:
x Patients should be assessed for conditions that require transmission-based
precautions to prioritize those who may require urgent care and isolation.
x Patients with high suspicion of transmissible infection should be
accommodated in designated areas to minimize transmission of infection to
other patients.
x Patients with respiratory symptoms should be provided a medical/surgical
mask and educated in cough etiquette.
Procedures and practices for IPC 57
x Minimize the stay of infectious patients in OPD by decreasing the waiting time
before consultation and facilitate early departure from clinics.59
Decision for patient placement
A decision on the placement of a patient suffering from a transmissible disease
needs to be based on the transmissibility, route of transmission, condition of the
patient, that is whether the patient needs intensive care or end-of-life support.60
Factors to be considered for decision on patient placement are:
x mode and route of disease transmission;
x clinical factors
R e.g. diarrhoea, cough, exudates, broken skin, mental impairment,
incontinence
R immune status of the patient or cohorts
x room availability;
x requirement as per public health advisory
R e.g. pandemic influenza, Ebola and Nipah.
Placement in protective environment and isolation
A protective environment with ultra clean unidirectional air may be required for
neutropenic patients and in some units such as transplant and oncology according
to the level of immunosuppression of the patients.61
To minimize airborne particles, air must be circulated in the room with a velocity
of at least 0.25 m/s through a HEPA filter. The HEPA filter removes particles of
up to a certain defined size. If particles >0.3 microns in diameter are removed,
the air entering the room can be classified as being clean and free of bacterial
contamination.
Other ways of protecting patients with severely lowered immune systems are:
x Visitors should avoid contact with the patient if they have infections (e.g. upper
respiratory tract infections or herpes simplex blisters).
x Where appropriate, staff and visitors should wear PPE to protect the patient
from microorganisms.
x Flowers or plants should not be put in the patient’s room and a clean
environment must be ensured.
x Environmental cleaning should be done twice daily and should consist of damp
dusting and floor mopping to avoid creating aerosols.
x Strict aseptic techniques must be used for all clinical procedures.
58 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Placement of patient with transmissible disease
Appropriate patient placement is a significant component of isolation precaution. A
patient with a highly transmissible disease (e.g. chicken pox, TB, measles) should be
placed in a single room with hand washing and toilet facility and airborne isolation.62
x Cohorting patients: When a single room is not available, an infected patient
is placed with another patient infected with the same microorganism. Only
assigned HCWs must take care of those patients, especially during outbreaks.
x If a single room is not available, then arrangements can be made for isolating
such patients at the corner of a ward where ventilation is adequate.
x Patient’s relatives/attendants should be educated on mode of transmission,
hand hygiene and PPE.
Air and ventilation
Introduction
Air is the source of airborne infections of which TB is the most common and endemic
in India. Other airborne infections are measles and chicken pox. SARS and other
serious respiratory viral infections can be transmitted through the air during aerosol-
generating procedures such as intubation and bronchoscopy. Varicella (including
disseminated zoster), highly pathogenic influenza, and smallpox may also be
transmitted through the air route. Airborne infection occurs through droplet nuclei
of less than 5 microns. These particles remain suspended in air through various
lengths of time and can travel over distances greater than 1 metre and at times
even from room to room.
Ventilation can reduce the risk of infection through dilution and removal of infectious
particles through air exchange. Improved ventilation in HCFs is essential in
preventing transmission of TB and other airborne infections.
Ventilation systems
Table 5.1 gives a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of different types
of ventilation systems for healthcare settings.63
Natural ventilation
x Refers to fresh air that enters and leaves a room or other area through
openings such as windows or doors.
x Natural ventilation is “controlled” when openings are fixed and unrestricted to
maintain air flow at all times.
x Unrestricted openings (i.e. those that cannot be closed) on opposite sides of a
room provide the most effective natural ventilation.
x In existing HCFs that have natural ventilation, when possible, effective
ventilation should be achieved by proper operation and maintenance
of openings, and by regular checks to see that openings remain free of
obstruction at all times.

Source: Guidelines on Airborne Infection Control in Healthcare and Other Settings63
x Simple natural ventilation can be optimized by maximizing the size of the
windows, opening up fixed window panes and locating windows on opposite
walls.
x Ventilation can also be optimized by the use of “mixing fans”. Types of mixing
fans include ceiling fans, stand/desk mounted fans, or window/exhaust fans
located in open windows.
Control of environment 61
Mixing of air can disperse pockets of high concentration of infectious particles, such
as in the vicinity of patients.
The total number of infectious particles in the room will not change with mixing.
Unless adequate ventilation is present, mixing fans will not be useful in dispersing
infectious particles and reducing the risk of transmission.
A common problem with reliance on natural ventilation is that patients or staff close
windows during cold weather or at night. Further, there is likely to be variability of
airflow patterns due to varying weather. In colder climates where rooms are closed
to keep the temperature adequately high even in winter, natural ventilation can be
implemented by airing via windows at frequent intervals. If natural ventilation is
inadequate, additional mechanical ventilation or other measures may be needed,
especially in areas where the risk of transmission of TB is high.
Mechanical ventilation
Mechanical ventilation uses fans to drive the airflow through a building.
x Mechanical ventilation can be fully controlled and combined with air-
conditioning and filtration systems as is normally done in some office buildings.
x Mechanical ventilation includes “mixed mode ventilation”, in which exhaust
and/or supply fans are used in combination with natural ventilation to obtain
adequate dilution when a sufficient ventilation rate cannot be achieved by
natural ventilation alone.
x Mechanical ventilation with or without climate control may be appropriate
where natural ventilation cannot be implemented effectively, or where such
systems are inadequate given local conditions (e.g. building structure, climate,
regulations, culture, cost and outdoor air quality).
Exhaust fans
The simplest form of mechanical ventilation is the use of exhaust fans, placed for
instance in windows, to move air from inside a room to the outdoors.
x Exhaust fans may also be more acceptable to staff and patients than keeping
windows consistently open.
x If exhaust fans are used, it is important to ensure that airflow is adequate, that
air flows across the room (not in and out the same window or vent), and that
exhaust fans and air intake (windows or vents) are not located so that short-
circuiting may occur.
62 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Challenges of achieving adequate ventilation and climate control
x Effective ventilation is often at odds with efforts to make indoor climate more
comfortable. In practice, air cooling or heating with re-circulation of air is more
energy efficient.
x The implication of installing a split air-conditioning and closing the doors and
windows is, however, complete lack of air exchange.
x It is possible for rooms with air conditioning or heaters to have adequate
ventilation. Careful attention must be given to ensuring adequate ventilation
when installing climate control.
Minimum air-changes per hour
HCFs should maintain a minimum amount of ventilation during all climatic conditions.
These recommendations are based on the minimum ventilation rate estimated to
reduce the probability of infection in an enclosed room to less than 5% with an hour
of exposure to an infectious source case.
Table 5.2 gives the minimum air-changes per hour (ACH) required for various
healthcare settings.
Standards for natural ventilation

natural ventilation, the following standards for ventilation ensure that air exchange
is safely >12 ACH under all climactic conditions:
x Natural ventilation should be "controlled", with fixed, unrestricted openings that
are insensitive to climactic conditions.
x Openings should constitute >20% of floor area.
x Openings should be on two sides, preferably opposite sides, for example, a
100 sq. feet room should have >10 sq. feet fixed, unrestricted openings on two
sites, for a total of 20 sq. feet.
Considerations for hot climates
Climatic extremes may require some adjustments to ensure that minimum ventilation
standards are achieved. In the case of hot climatic conditions, the following design
considerations should be kept in mind.
x Air conditioners must be avoided, or used very cautiously in patient care
areas. If air conditioners are used, it must be acknowledged that the need to
maintain adequate ventilation for airborne infection control may to some degree
necessarily compromise the comfort of the occupants and the efficiency of the
air conditioner.
x Solar heat gain must be minimized through proper use of sunshades or
external shading.
x Outdoor shaded waiting areas must be used to the greatest extent possible.
x Where augmentation of ventilation is required, the use of air supply fans may
help improve thermal comfort, compared to exhaust fans.
x The use of evaporative coolers (“desert coolers”) may be an effective solution
to achieve both comfort and adequate ventilation, as these tend to have
powerful fans. Proper maintenance, however, is essential. An online tool
for estimating the total fan rating for a given room can be found at http://
www.csgnetwork.com/airexchangecalc.html. This reference is provided for
convenience, and is not an endorsement of the site.
x The installation of “whirlybirds” (also known as whirligigs or wind turbines) that
do not use electricity and provide a roof exhaust system can greatly increase
both ventilation and comfort.
Considerations for cold climates
In cold climates, high ventilation rates may adversely affect thermal comfort, and
are difficult to achieve as windows may be closed to keep the building warm. Even
if normal heating is introduced, high ventilation rates usually mean low energy
efficiency. Therefore, ventilation and heating strategies must be planned carefully.
64 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x The building design should seek to capture solar heat and minimize conduction
loss through the wall. Proper insulation of walls and the use of double glazing
on windows are desirable.
x Where augmentation of ventilation is required, the use of air exhaust fans may
help maintain adequate ventilation, even where windows or doors are closed.
x Targeted radiant or direct near-body heating methods are more effective than
common convective radiators. This includes modern electric coil heaters and
heated blankets/ mattresses.
Directional control of air flow
x Directional control of air flow is recommended in specific high-risk settings
where infectious patients with drug-resistant TB or other acute respiratory
diseases of potential concern are likely to be managed – i.e. airborne
precaution rooms, MDR-TB wards and clinics, and bronchoscopy suites.
x There should be a system in place for minimizing the chance of airflow from the
room to other parts of the facility. In a room relying on natural ventilation that is
situated away from other patient care areas, no additional changes would be
required. However, it would be important to keep the doors to the corridor or
other rooms closed, to prevent the escape of infectious aerosols to other parts
of the facility.
x Assessment of the direction of air movement can be done easily using smoke
tubes, strips of ribbon, or by observing the directionality of dense smoke from
“dhoop” or incense stick.
x Directional control of airflow can be achieved in mixed mode ventilation by
paying proper attention to adequate exhaust and supply ventilation.
Optimal arrangement of patients and staff in relation to the direction of air flow
x Healthcare staff should be mindful of the direction of airflow to ensure they are
closest to the clean air source, and that patients are closest to the exhaust.
This involves arranging patients and staff so that contaminated air is not likely
to cross directly into staff/patient spaces.
x The natural direction of air flow should be between patients and staff, and not
across patients and staff. This is especially important for settings such as DOT
centres, OPD examination rooms, and smear microscopy laboratories.
Seating arrangement in a naturally ventilated room is given in Fig. 5.1. The
healthcare worker is marked with a red cross. Seating “B” is better than seating “A”
as the potentially infected air from the patient with airborne disease does not cross
the healthcare worker.
Control of environment 65
A diagrammatical representation of a mechanically ventilated room with optimum
directional airflow control is shown in Fig. 5.2. In “A” the supply of air is on one side
and exhaust on the other; whereas in “B”, the supply is from the top and exhaust
near the patients’ head and foot end.
Filtration (HEPA filters)
Filtration is another option to remove infectious particles from the air. Filtration may
be considered where:
x sustainable resources for membrane replacement and maintenance are
assured;
x natural ventilation is not possible; and
x risk of airborne transmission and morbidity are high such as bronchoscopy
suites, laboratories and individual rooms for patients with TB.
Filtration devices perform poorly in high-dust conditions, as the effectiveness in
terms of equivalent air exchange can diminish rapidly. Attention should be given to
the equivalent air exchanges per hour that the filter requires. If filters are chosen,
only true-HEPA membrane filters (rated to remove 99.97% of 1-micron particles)
should be entertained.
Other filtration mechanisms, such as ionizers, have not been adequately studied.
The use of single rooms with HEPA filtration may reduce the risk of HAI by airborne
fungi, in particular Aspergillus spp. This is particularly important where renovation,
building or demolition are in progress in the hospital or nearby.
Fig. 5.1. Seating arrangement in a naturally ventilated room63
66 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems
In modern hospitals, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems
control the concentration of airborne particulates in high-risk areas such as
transplant units, operation theatres, intensive care units, and burn units to minimize
the risk of infection by means of air pressure, flow control and air filtration (the
physical removal of particulates from air). The three types of filtration used in central
airconditioning are (i) coarse or pre-filters for large particles; (ii) micro-fine filters
which filter up to 5 microns; and (iii) HEPA filters which keep out up to 0.3 microns
with 99.97% efficiency.
There is evidence that there is a lower incidence of infection when immune-
compromised and other high-acuity patients are housed in HEPA-filtered isolation
rooms.
Laminar air flow64,65
This is HEPA-filtered air blown in a unidirectional pattern with 100–400 ACH.
LAF systems are thought to minimize contamination of the surgical field with
airborne microbes and thus to contribute to reducing SSIs. LAF systems should be
available for prolonged procedures such as transplant and replacement surgery,
neurosurgery, orthopaediac and implant surgery.
Airborne precaution room
Airborne precaution rooms can be naturally ventilated or mechanically ventilated.
It is acknowledged that mechanical ventilation is expensive to instal and maintain
Fig. 5.2. Diagram of mechanical ventilated room with optimum directional airflow control63

Control of environment 67
in precaution rooms, often does not deliver the recommended ventilation rate, and
may fail to maintain negative pressure.
Recommended specifications and procedures for airborne precaution rooms are:
1. Room layout
x Post signage on the door.
x Ensure appropriate hand-washing facilities.
x Ensure appropriate room ventilation (>12 ACH).
x Ensure directional control of airflow, with air flow entering the room only when
the door is open, and exhausted outside safely.
x In naturally ventilated airborne precaution rooms, the air flow should be
directed to areas free of transit, or safely outside where it may be diluted.
x In mechanically ventilated airborne precaution rooms, to control the direction
of air flow the pressure of the room should be maintained slightly less than the
pressure of the entry area (i.e. “negative pressure”), so that air flows into the
room when doors are open:
R clean-to-dirty airflow;
R a negative pressure differential of >2.5 Pa (0.01-inch water gauge);
R an airflow differential >125-cfm (56 L/s) exhaust relative to supply;
R sealing of the room, allowing approximately 0.5 square feet (0.046 sq.
metre) leakage; and
R an exhaust to the outside, or a HEPA-filter if room air is re-circulated.
2. Room setup
x Remove all non-essential furniture; the rest should be easy to clean, and
should not conceal or retain dirt or moisture within or around it.
x Set up a trolley outside the door to hold PPE.
x Stock PPE supply and linen outside the precaution room/area (e.g. in the
changing room).
x Stock the sink area with suitable supplies for hand washing, and with ABHR
near the point-of-care and room door.
x Place appropriate waste bags in a bin. If possible, use a touch-free bin. Dirty
bins should remain inside the precaution rooms.
x Place a puncture-proof container for sharps disposal inside the precaution
room/area.
x Place an appropriate container with a lid outside the door for equipment that
requires disinfection or sterilization.
3. Procedures
x Before being allowed into the airborne precaution areas, visitors should consult
68 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
the nurse in charge, who is also responsible for keeping a visitor record. A
roster of all staff working in the airborne precaution areas should also be kept
for possible outbreak investigation and contact tracing.
x Patient-care equipment that is required for use by other patients should be
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before use.
x Ensure scrupulous daily cleaning of the airborne precaution room/area.
Cleaning and sanitation
Need for cleaning and sanitation
Dry conditions favour the persistence of gram-positive cocci (e.g. coagulase-
negative Staphylococcus spp.) in dust and on surfaces, whereas moist, soiled
environments favour the growth and persistence of gram-negative bacilli. Fungal
spores are present in dust and fungi can proliferate in moist, fibrous material.
Pathogenic organisms that survive in the environment can be a source of infection to
patients admitted in the hospital. Therefore, it is important to clean the environment
thoroughly on a regular basis. This will reduce the bacterial load, get rid of soil and
make the environment unsuitable for growth of microorganisms.
Hospitals need to practice and maintain the highest standards of hygiene and an
environment conducive for speedy patient recovery.
General principles of cleaning and sanitation66
Regardless of the agent used for cleaning, the following protocol must be followed:
x Staff should be properly trained on the practices of cleaning and
decontamination of hospital surfaces.
x Appropriate PPE should be worn and a log of all cleaning procedures must be
maintained.
x Housekeeping surfaces can be divided into two groups – those with minimal
hand-contact (e.g. floors, and ceilings) and those with frequent hand-contact
or “high touch surfaces” (e.g. doorknobs, bedrails, light switches, wall areas
around the toilet in the patient’s room, and the edges of privacy curtains).
x All housekeeping surfaces (floors/table tops/counters) should be cleaned on a
regular basis, when visibly soiled and when spills occur. Either hot water or a
neutral detergent may be used or a detergent/disinfectant may be used.
x Housekeeping surfaces should be cleaned with a detergent/disinfectant
solution on daily basis or more frequently in specific high-risk areas (ICUs,
transplant units, isolation rooms, burns wards, OTs, emergency rooms, or
Control of environment 69
when there are suspected spills of blood/body fluids) and in areas that have
patients with known transmissible infectious diseases.
x All horizontal surfaces and all toilet areas including washbasins and commodes
should be cleaned daily.
x Administrative and office areas with no patient contact require normal domestic
cleaning.
x Fresh detergent/disinfectant solutions must be prepared every day according
to manufacturers’ instructions. These solutions must be replaced with fresh
solutions frequently.
x Diluted disinfectant solutions may become contaminated with resistant
pathogens. Therefore, after the day’s use, remaining solutions must be
discarded and containers must be cleaned with detergent before being dried.
x High-touch surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected more frequently than
minimal-touch surfaces.
x The methods of cleaning floors include wet mopping, and vacuum cleaning
with filters attached. Avoid dry mopping with brooms, as this generates dust
aerosols.
x Horizontal surfaces must be wet dusted with a cloth moistened with a hospital
disinfectant (or detergent).
x Contamination of cleaning solutions and mops must be minimized. For wet
mopping, a two-bucket method should be used. When a single bucket is used,
the solutions should be changed more frequently. Used cleaning solutions
must be discarded in the sluice. The buckets should be cleaned with detergent
and kept inverted to assist drying.
x Mop heads must be changed after cleaning spills and at the beginning of the
day.
x Mop heads and cleaning cloths must be decontaminated regularly by
laundering (heat disinfection) with detergent and drying at 80°C.
x Walls, blinds and window curtains must be cleaned when visibly soiled or
contaminated.
x Disinfectant fogging is not recommended for routine patient care areas.
x Bacteriological testing of the environment is NOT RECOMMENDED as a
routine unless seeking a potential source of an outbreak.
Blood and body substance spill management
Splashes of body fluids on walls and surfaces can be cleaned by using a high-level
disinfectant.
x Use PPE (gloves, face masks and fluid-resistant gowns) for cleaning blood
spills. Wear protective shoe covers/boots when cleaning large spills.
70 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x For decontamination of small spills (<10 ml), if sodium hypochlorite solution
is selected, use a 1:100 dilution (525–615ppm of available chlorine) (Table
5.3). If spills involve larger amounts of blood, or involve a spill of microbiology
cultures in the laboratory, a 1:10 dilution of hypochlorite solution for first
application (before cleaning) reduces the risk of infection during cleaning. After
the first application, remove the visible organic matter with absorbent material
(e.g. disposable paper towels), discard into leak-proof, labelled bag/container
and then dispose of as per waste management guidelines.
Cleaning agents and disinfectants for environmental use
A neutral detergent and warm water solution should be used for all routine and
general cleaning. When a disinfectant is required for surface cleaning, e.g. after
spillage or contamination with blood or body fluids, or in special areas such as the
surgical unit, dialysis unit and ICU, the manufacturer’s recommendations for use and
occupational health and safety instructions should be followed. Table 5.4 lists the
disinfectants used for the environment, their recommended use and precautions.

Bleach solution becomes unstable rapidly, hence it needs to be freshly prepared daily
or changed on becoming dirty/turbid. Chlorine bleach can be corrosive. Protect metal
instruments by thoroughly rinsing them with water after soaking for 10 minutes.
Policy for cleaning, sanitation and disinfection
The healthcare facility should develop a policy for cleaning, sanitation and
disinfection of environmental surfaces.
72 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
The key elements are:
x The interiors and external areas and premises of the hospital should be kept
clean and odour free.
x Solid waste and garbage should be removed and disposed of hygienically.
x A hospital cleaning manual should be developed to provide detailed guidelines
for procedures and practices.
x There should be a cleaning schedule for daily, weekly and terminal cleaning.
The cleaning process, be it for a single room, or ward, must be coordinated
with the nurse in-charge.
An example of a cleaning and sanitation policy including methods and procedures
for cleaning various areas in the hospital is provided in Annex 5.2.
Safety of cleaning and sanitation staff
x Housekeeping staff should be enrolled in the hospitals occupational health
programme and provided immunization against Hepatitis B and tetanus.
x Appropriate and adequate PPE should be provided and staff trained in its use.
x Training should be provided in safe work practice, IPC policies and procedures
relevant to their work and biomedical waste management.
x If commercial/outsourced housekeeping is used then contract housekeeping
must comply with the infection prevention and control policies and guidelines.
Accidental exposure to blood or body substances
Inoculation injuries, such as needle-stick, other sharps injuries, bites, scratches
and splash contamination of broken skin require immediate action:
x The area should be washed with soap and running water and bleeding should
be encouraged. The wound should not be sucked.
x A waterproof dressing should be applied.
Splashes to intact skin: The affected area should be washed immediately with
warm soapy water.
Splashes to the mouth: The mouth should be rinsed with large quantities of water.
Splashes to the eyes: Eyes should be irrigated immediately with water or, if
available, with sterile saline.
Reporting
Inoculation injuries, splashes to mouth, eyes and mucous membranes should be
Control of environment 73
reported to the department manager and to the occupational health department or
the emergency department for further advice, whichever is specified by the hospital
policy.
For protection of the healthcare worker, see Chapter 8 and Annex 4.
Safe water and food
Provision of safe water
HCFs should have adequate and continuous supply of safe water. Safe water
should be available for drinking, hand washing, food preparation, personal hygiene,
medical activities, cleaning and laundry. The requirement of water for hospitals with
a bed strength of less than 100 is 340 litres/bed/day, whereas for hospitals with bed
strength over 100 beds, it is 400 litres/bed/day.
Water in healthcare facilities should be of drinking water quality and meet the
national standards for drinking water. The institution is responsible for the quality of
water once it enters the building. Drinking water should be safe for oral ingestion.
Tap water may not be safe for drinking in our country and requires treatment to be
safe for oral ingestion and to meet the standards for drinking water. Contaminated
water from the water system can be a source of infection. Biofilms are slimy layers
consisting of a community of microorganisms that form on surfaces immersed
in water. Biofilms in storage tanks, tap water and showers have been linked to
nosocomial outbreaks. Faecal contamination of water can also occur and unless
adequate treatment is provided, contamination may be sufficient to cause infection
through hand washing, food preparation, bathing, and during the general care of
patients.
The criteria for drinking water are not adequate for medical uses of water.67
Medical
uses of water requires additional treatment. Some of the medical uses of water are:
purified water for the preparation of injections which must be sterile, water required
for haemodialysis which should be purified and free from contaminants and has
its own standards. Bacterial and endotoxin limits for dialysis fluids are given in
Chapter6.
Reducing water-borne transmission
Waste water from healthcare facilities may lead to the contamination of the municipal
water system, surface water or ground water of the community and therefore should
be adequately treated.68
Waste water from a hospital needs to be treated by an effluent treatment plant as
74 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
directed by the Biomedical Waste Management and Handling Rules 2016, 2018
(see Chapter 5 and Annex 8.4).
Water supply system
x It should be designed and maintained with proper temperature and adequate
pressure.
x Stagnation and back flow should be minimized and dead-end pipes should be
avoided.
x Growth of Pseudomonas spp. and other bacteria can be prevented if the
water system maintains water at the right temperatures, i.e. cold water at a
temperature below 20°C, stored hot water above 60°C, and circulated hot
water with a minimum return temperature of 51°C.
x Clean water pipes should not run alongside waste water pipes as this may lead
to waste water being sucked into the clean water pipes through leaking cracks
and joints.
x When the water system cannot supply water of the recommended standards
for drinking, measures such as boiling, chlorine treatment, and filtration or
reverse osmosis are recommended at the point of use.
Point-of-use fixtures
x Water fixtures such as sinks, faucets, aerators, showers, and toilets have been
identified as potential reservoirs for pathogenic microorganisms.
x Regular cleaning, disinfection and preventive maintenance protocols should be
followed, especially in areas housing immuno-compromised patients.
Water storage tanks
Due to the lack of continuous running water, many hospitals have to use stored
water. These storage tanks can be large overhead tanks or smaller tanks at the
ward level. Overhead storage tanks should have the capacity to store 48 hours of
water requirement.
Large overhead water tanks
Water storage tanks should be covered with appropriate sealed lids and need to be
under lock and key. The tanks should be thoroughly cleaned at regular intervals.
Water storage tanks at ward level
x The cleaning of potable water storage tank at the ward level should be done
daily and the tank must be provided with a tap or stop cock.
x The tank should be kept securely covered at all times.
Control of environment 75
x Water provided for drinking must be adequately filtered or treated by reverse
osmosis. Boiled and cooled water should be provided to immune-compromised
patients. Water should be boiled in a covered container to 100°C for
20 minutes, cooled, covered and then used. Boiled water standing for over
8 hours should not be used for drinking.
x Disposable plastic water bottles should not be used. Traditional stainless steel
jugs and cup/glass should be provided and daily cleaning should be ensured.
x Water filters/RO systems should be regularly maintained. Their efficacy should
be checked regularly and records maintained. Random sampling of water for
microbiological analysis should be done periodically.
x Patients and their relatives should be educated about the importance of safe
drinking water.
Procedure and schedule for water tank cleaning
x The tanks must be emptied completely by using pumps, followed by thoroughly
cleaning water tanks from inside including all walls, floor, beams and ceiling
and any other parts.
x Water must be bailed out manually or by pumping, draining out and removing
all the residual water and silt.
x Cleaning should be done manually first and then mechanically by using stiff
wire brushes and then removing all fungus/algae. by using soda bicarbonate/
bleaching powder of approved grade and quantity, followed by flushing
thoroughly with water.
x All corners and joints must be heated with hot air to kill germs, and then rinsed
thoroughly twice by clean water.
x The workers should wear clean gloves, masks and gum boots for safety.
x The work should be organized so as not to disturb the routine.
x Cleaning should be carried out over the weekend/holiday after office hours of
the hospital and in consultation with the engineer in-charge.
x Refilling of tanks should be started only after due inspection is carried out by
the engineer in-charge.
x All tools such as ladders, brushes, pump, hot air guns, buckets and drums
required for this work should be as specified by the engineer in-charge.
Plumbing job guidelines
x The hospital water supply system must not be connected to any other piping
system or fixtures that could allow contamination without the use of adequate
air gaps or approved back flow preventers or vacuum breakers.
x When using implements to unstop faulty drains, rubber gloves should be worn.
76 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x When cleaning out main sewer lines, or when exposed to gross contaminated
wastes, protective gear such as rubber boots and rubber gloves, goggles and
mask must be worn. Equipment and machines must be used as per regulations
for cleaning sewer lines.
x After exposure to sewer lines or gross contaminated waste, the exposed
areas of the body should be cleaned with soap and water. Change uniform if
necessary. Do not return to patient care areas before cleaning up.
Microbiological testing of water69
Water used for drinking, handwashing, cleaning and disinfection should be tested
as decided by the HICC. The suggested frequency is every three months and
additionally if the source of water is changed, or after major repairs of the water
supply system, or when a water-borne outbreak is suspected. Suggested sites
of collection of water for testing are: hand wash/scrub sinks in OT, ICUs, OPD/
emergency, ward that caters to maximum number of patients, RO/filtered water,
drinking water sources. The samples should show absence of coliform organisms.
Disinfection of water sources
Water sources and tanks may be disinfected by adding chlorine in the form of
bleaching powder, high strength calcium hypochlorite or liquid bleach. The quantity
of the chemicals needed to disinfect water for drinking can be calculated, the dose
being approximately 0.7 mg of applied chlorine per litre of water.
The testing of water sources for free chlorine is done to measure the potability of
water. The presence of free chlorine should be at 0.2 ppm, which indicates that
adequate amount of chlorine was added to inactivate the contaminating bacteria
and viruses and that the water will be free from contamination during storage.
Provision of safe food and kitchen hygiene
The quality and quantity of food are key factors for patient convalescence. Ensuring
safe food is an important service delivery in healthcare.70
The dietary department ensures that food prepared and served to patients, visitors
and employees is received, stored, prepared and served in a manner that avoids
contamination. The aim is to prevent food- and water-borne infections. The dietary
department should have a manual in which all the procedures for preparation and
handling of food are available.
The guidance document by the FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of
India) on food management system must be followed.71
Control of environment 77
Risk factors in hospital kitchens
These are mainly due to contamination of food, stale food, storing food at room
temperature or inadequate refrigeration, unhygienic preparation of enteral or baby
feeds, with food-handlers being carriers. Food contamination can be prevented by:
x reliable and good quality supplies;
x adequate storage facilities;
x hygienic precautions;
x personal hygiene, hand hygiene;
x use of uniform including hair covering and gloves;
x screening of food handlers for infectious diseases (enteric, respiratory or skin
infections).
Kitchen procedures
Pre-preparation
The pre-preparation area must be well segregated into dry and wet zones. All contact
surfaces must be pre-sanitized. Vegetarian cutting boards must be sanitized with
50 ppm chlorine and non-vegetarian cutting boards with 100ppm chlorine, with a
minimum contact of 2–3 hours.
Storage facilities
x There must be adequate storage facilities for all items including food
ingredients, equipment, and non-food materials such as utensils, linen, single-
service and single-use articles, packaging and chemical agents. During
storage, food items must be protected from contamination such as water
leakage, pest infestation or any other insanitary condition. Adequate off-the-
floor shelves and racks must be used for storing food. Floors should not be
used for storing food.
x The storage area must be cleanable and in a dry location to prevent
deterioration. It should be protected from pests and should be away from locker
rooms, toilets, sewer lines, stores of chemicals/pesticides.
x The storage facilities should be designed and constructed to avoid cross-
contamination.
x Cold storage at 4°C–8°C and freezer at −18°C should be provided for foods
that need refrigeration and for frozen foods, with a separate refrigerator and
freezer for vegetarian and non-vegetarian products.
x Separate storage sections should be provided for raw, processed, packaging,
rejected, returned or recalled food items. Allergen material or foods like
groundnuts must be distinguishably marked.
x Cleaning agents should have prominent labels and stored separately.
78 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Food temperature
Cold food items are refrigerated and maintained at 4°C–8°C or below.
Walk-in storage facilities are maintained at the following temperatures and the
temperatures are checked daily and a log is maintained of the temperatures.
Foods prepared to be served cold are cooled from their preparation temperature to
4°C or below. The cooling period should not exceed 4 hours. Hot foods are held
at an internal temperature of 63°C or above. Both hot and cold food items should
be transported in food trolleys in such a manner that appropriate temperatures are
maintained during the transportation of the food.
Food type Temperature
Frozen food −18°C
Cooked food Above 60°C
Cold food Below 5°C
Dry stores At room temperature
Special formula food
Infant formulas and other formulas prepared by the dietary department and ward
pantry are subject to specific preparation and storage policies and procedures
that may be found in the dietary department manual. These are microbiologically
checked only when epidemics occur.
Food for immune-compromised patients
The food for this set of patients should be double cooked. Food should be cooked
again in a pressure cooker just before serving.
Food distribution
x Food trays are placed in food trolleys which are brought to the ward from the
kitchen. The trays are dispensed in the ward. Food should be handled in a
hygienic manner throughout this process. Trays should be kept covered when
food is served in the ward.
x Dietary workers should be taught to observe standard precautions to protect
themselves and patients.
Cleaning of utensils
x The returned trays should be heat treated to render the items sanitized (wash
temperature 65°C–70°C, rinse temperature 85°C–95°C).
Control of environment 79
x If a utensil is cleaned in a pantry at the ward level, hot water connection should
be provided for effective cleaning and disinfection.
Kitchen staff hygiene
Dietary personnel should be taught to protect food consumers from their body
substances. Barriers (see uniform below) should be provided to dietary personnel,
and hygienic practices should be taught and supervised as per the guidance in the
catering section of the guideline of FSSAI.
Uniform
Uniform must be changed daily and provision must be made to supply clean uniform
daily.
x Aprons
x Hair covering and caps
x Gloves
x Footwear: dedicated footwear is to be used in kitchens.
Screening for infectious diseases (enteric, respiratory or skin infection)
All food handlers must undergo medical examination by a registered medical
practitioner and must be free from infectious and transmissible diseases.
Employees should report the following conditions to the supervisor for possible
exclusion from food handling areas—jaundice, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, sore
throat with fever, visibly infected lesions, boils, cuts, sores and discharge from ears/
eyes/nose, etc. (Personnel with open cuts, wounds or burns shall be required to
cover them with suitably waterproof dressings before starting operation.)
Food handlers must maintain a high degree of personal hygiene.
Hair, nails, and moustache/beard must be properly trimmed and hair must be tied
and gloves worn at all times.
Hand hygiene
Hands should be washed after handling non-food chemicals and incompatible food
products (such as raw versus cooked food) or contaminated material.
Hand washing should be mandatory and repeated after using the toilet, eating or
drinking, arranging or combing the hair, touching the face, nose or eyes, contact
with unclean equipment and work surfaces and after handling raw food. Placement
of liquid soap and single use towel in the toilets is mandatory.
80 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Personnel should wash exposed portions of their arms and hands with soap and
water before starting work.
Personal habits
Staff should keep short nails and not wear religious bands, wrist bands, rings,
bracelets and nail polish on duty.
x Keep clothing free from obvious dirt and food spills.
x Use hair nets (hair restraints) while on duty.
x Use serving tools/utensils to handle food whenever possible.
x Do not consume food or drinks in the food preparation or serving areas.
x Do not use tobacco product in any form while engaged in the preparation or
serving of food.
Environmental hygiene and sanitation
x Kitchen design should be appropriate. This includes areas for receiving raw
material, storage of material, facility for storing perishable items, i.e. cold
storage, facility for “first in first out” particularly for raw food such as onion and
potato. Adequate supply of clean (potable) water should be ensured.
x Raw material cutting surfaces should be segregated because raw material
such as spinach and vegetables with roots bring in soil and dirt.
x Food should be served as soon as possible after preparation.
Water
Uninterrupted potable water and hot water supply in kitchen should be available.
Cleaning schedule
x All surfaces should be cleaned with detergent and hot water followed by drying
which is mandatory.
x Chopping boards should be cleaned and disinfected after cutting.
x Kitchen should be kept dry. Separate area should be provided for washing.
Utensils and vessels should be washed in a sink.
x Cleaning activities should be recorded.
x Cleaning of areas where special meals are prepared should be done using
separate and dedicated cleaning equipment.
Maintenance of refrigerators and cold storage
Regular temperature check and cleaning of refrigerators should be done according
to a schedule, which should be recorded.
Control of environment 81
Disposal of waste from the kitchen
Food returned to the kitchen should be discarded. These and other dietary wastes
should be kept in bins lined by black plastic bags outside the dietary department,
which are removed regularly.
Raw kitchen material after cutting vegetables, fruits, etc. can be composted if place
is available.
Waste stores and dustbins must be kept appropriately clean, free of pests and in
closed conditions and should be disposed of as per local rules and regulations
including those for plastic and other non-environment-friendly materials.
Environment Control
This includes maintenance of ventilation, lighting, plumbing, drainage system, floors,
walls, ceilings, doors and windows, service lift cleaning schedule and maintenance.
Weekly thorough cleaning of kitchen should be carried out and recorded.
Ventilation
Natural/mechanical ventilation systems including air filters and exhaust fans should
be provided. They should prevent grease or condensation from collecting on the
walls and ceiling, and must be easy to clean. Maintaining good ventilation system
in the kitchen is necessary. Regular cleaning of all vents/AC filters must be carried
out in a systematic manner at least once a week; record to be maintained by the
engineering department.
Hygienic transportation of food
x The conveyance must be clean, maintained and repaired so that there is no
food contamination.
x Adequate temperature must be maintained for all types of foods and must be
protected from pests, foreign matter and environmental pollution.
x The conveyance must be used only to carry food and for no other purpose.
Outbreaks
Bacterial food poisoning (acute gastroenteritis) is an infection or intoxication
manifested by abdominal pain and diarrhoea, with or without vomiting or fever. The
onset of symptoms may range from less than one hour to more than 48 hours after
eating contaminated food. Usually, large numbers of organisms actively growing in
food are required to initiate symptoms of infection or intoxication. Water, milk, and
solid foods are all vehicles for transmission.
82 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
When a food-borne illness is suspected, the HICC is notified. The Microbiology
department will obtain specimens from the symptomatic individuals and from
suspected food. The HICC will be responsible for obtaining significant histories and
conducting the investigation of a suspected food-borne illness.
Biomedical waste
The modern hospital is a complex multidisciplinary system which consumes several
types of items for the delivery of patient care. All these products consumed in the
hospital have some unusable leftovers which are called healthcare/clinical waste
as they are generated as a result of some clinical activity. Biomedical waste is a
broader term applied to waste generated in the diagnosis, treatment or immunization
of humans and animals, in research or in the production and testing of biological
products.72
It also includes the waste coming out of medical treatment given at
home or in health camps.
Infectious waste
Infectious waste includes all healthcare/clinical waste which has the potential to
transmit viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic disease. It includes both human and
animal waste, waste generated in laboratories and veterinary practice. Hazardous
waste is any waste with a potential to pose a threat to human health and life.
Infectious waste is a part of hazardous waste.
Any waste contaminated with blood, body fluids, excretions and secretions is
potentially infectious. One of the most hazardous waste is contaminated sharp
waste which is a part of infectious waste and can also cause injury. The most
common documented transmission of infection from waste to HCWs is through
contaminated needles. Laboratory waste is a major potential reservoir of pathogenic
microorganisms and requires appropriate handling.
Effect on human health and environment
Along with the effect on hospital personnel and patients within the hospital, the
impact on human health and environment outside the hospital is also important.
Infectious waste can transmit numerous diseases in the community and also to
those who handle waste. Besides, the increasing use of disposables in healthcare
is also posing an additional burden on the waste management facility. It is extremely
important that the unscrupulous reuse of these disposable items is prevented.
Health hazards associated with poor healthcare waste management are:
Control of environment 83
x Injuries from sharps to all categories of hospital staff and waste handlers;
x HAIs in patients because of poor IPC and poor waste management;
x Risks of infections outside hospitals for waste handlers, scavengers, and
eventually the general public, changes in microbial ecology, spread of
antimicrobial resistance; and
x Risks associated with handling of hazardous chemicals and drugs at all levels.
National Rules for biomedical waste management
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change published the Biomedical
Waste Management Rules on 28 March 2016. These rules superseded the
Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998. The 2016 Rules have
been amended in 2018 and 2019.
x These Rules apply to all persons who generate, collect, receive, store,
transport, treat, dispose, or handle biomedical waste in any form including
hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, dispensaries, veterinary institutions, animal
houses, pathological laboratories, blood banks, Ayush hospitals, clinical
establishments, research or educational institutions, health camps, medical or
surgical camps, vaccination camps, blood donation camps, first-aid rooms of
schools, forensic laboratories and research laboratories.
x Safe and proper identification, handling, storage, and disposal of biomedical
waste from laboratories and related facilities is the responsibility of every
occupier. "Occupier" means a person having administrative control over the
institution and the premises generating biomedical waste, which includes
a hospital, nursing home, clinic, dispensary, veterinary institution, animal
house, pathological laboratory, blood bank, HCF and clinical establishment,
irrespective of their system of medicine and by whatever name they are called.
Duties of the Occupier/HCF are given in Annex 8.1.
Box 5.1. Categories of waste*
x Yellow: for human anatomical waste, animal anatomical waste, soiled waste,
expired or discarded medicines, chemical waste, chemical liquid waste, discarded
contaminated beddings and microbiology, biotechnology and other clinical waste;
x Red: for contaminated plastic waste;
x White sharps bin: for metallic sharps; and
x Blue sharps bin: for glass sharps.
*As per the categories mentioned in Schedule I (see Annex 8.2)
84 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Management of biomedical waste
Waste segregation at point of generation
x HCF/laboratory waste requires management at every step from generation,
segregation, collection, transportation, storage, and treatment to final disposal.
x Of the waste generated in healthcare settings, approximately 10% to 25% is
hazardous but if not segregated properly, the entire waste becomes infectious
thereby escalating the overall cost of waste management. The most practical
approach to the management of biomedical waste is to identify and segregate
infectious waste, which would in turn drastically reduce the cost of waste
disposal in healthcare settings.
x Biomedical waste should be segregated into containers or bags at the point of
generation in accordance with Annex 8.2. This includes placing different types
of waste in different colour-coded-bags and containers at the site of generation.
x Proper segregation should identify waste according to type of waste and type
of disposal/disinfection (Annex 8.2).
x Colour-coded bags as per national norms (Annex 8.2) need to be placed in
appropriate containers with the appropriate label/ logo. For example, using a
biohazard symbol for infectious waste (Fig. 5.3).
x Puncture-proof containers made of plastic or metal with a biohazard symbol,
in blood collection areas, injection trolleys, nursing stations and OTs should be
made available for collecting metallic wastes.
x Syringes should be either mutilated or needles should be cut and/or stored in
tamper-proof, leak-proof and puncture-proof containers for sharps storage.
x Ensure segregation of liquid chemical waste at source and ensure pre-
treatment or neutralization before mixing with other effluent generated from
HCFs.

Control of environment 85
Collection bags
Solid waste is collected in leak-resistant heavy-duty bags. Coloured bags made of
non-chlorinated plastic with biohazard sign and labels mentioning date and details
of waste are to be used. The bags are tied tightly after they are three-fourths full.
Pre-treatment, packing, storage and transport
Laboratory waste, microbiological waste, blood samples and blood bags must be
pre-treated through disinfection or sterilization on site in the manner as prescribed
by the WHO guidelines on safe management of wastes from healthcare activities
and then sent to a common biomedical waste treatment facility for final disposal.
Standards for autoclaving are as given in Schedule II of the Biomedical Waste
Management Rules 2016 (Annex 8.4). The bags or containers used for waste
segregation shall be labelled as per Schedule IV of the Rules (Figs 5.3 and 5.4).
Provision must be made within the premises of an HCF for a safe, ventilated and
secured location for storage of segregated biomedical waste in coloured bags or
containers, inaccessible to scavengers and protected against insects, birds, animals
and rain, to ensure that there is no secondary handling, pilferage of recyclables,
or inadvertent scattering or spillage by animals. The biomedical waste from such
places or premises should be directly transported to the authorized common
biomedical waste treatment facility for the appropriate treatment and disposal.
Transport of biomedical waste to common biomedical waste treatment facility will
be done only in vehicles having appropriate label as provided in Part A of Schedule

x The handling and disposal of all the mercury waste and lead waste is to be
done in accordance with respective rules and regulations.
Biomedical waste handlers
x Immunize all HCWs and others, involved in handling of biomedical waste for
protection against diseases including hepatitis B and tetanus which are likely to
be transmitted by handling of biomedical waste, in a manner as prescribed in
the National Immunization Policy or the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare issued from time to time.
x Ensure occupational safety of all HCWs and others involved in handling of
biomedical waste by providing appropriate and adequate PPE.
x Conduct health check-up at the time of induction and at least once in a year for

at the time of induction and at least once a year thereafter.
x Records of the training programmes conducted, number of personnel trained
and number of personnel who have not undergone any training must be
maintained.
A. IPC in surgical units
Aseptic protocols
Personnel
Hand/forearm antisepsis for surgical team members is of crucial importance.
x Nails should be kept short and all jewellery, artificial nails or nail polish should
be removed before surgical hand preparation.
x Hands should be washed and debris should be removed from underneath
fingernails using a nail cleaner (not brushes), preferably under running water.
Sinks should be designed to reduce the risk of splashes.
x Surgical hand antisepsis should be performed using either a suitable
antimicrobial soap or ABHR, before donning sterile gloves.
x A preoperative surgical hand scrub should be done for at least 5 minutes using
an appropriate antiseptic scrub. Hands and forearms should be cleaned up to
the elbows.
x After performing the surgical hand scrub, hands should be kept up and away
from the body (elbows in flexed position) so that water runs from the tips of the
fingers toward the elbows and not vice versa.
x If running water is not available, clean stored water can be used. Water should
be stored in a bucket with a tap at one side to dispense water. If such a bucket
is not available, clean water can be poured on the hands with the help of a
container with a long handle. Another person should pour the water.
x If the quality of water is not assured in the OT, surgical hand antisepsis using
ABHR is recommended. A sufficient amount of ABHR should be applied to dry
hands and forearms for the length of time recommended by the manufacturer,
typically 1.5 minutes, and hands and forearms allowed to dry before donning
sterile gloves. (Steps for performing the surgical hand scrub are given in
Annex 9.1.)
6. Infection prevention and control in
special units or situations
90 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Scrubs
Microorganisms are constantly shed from the hair and skin of persons and also
from their clothes. Microorganisms are also expelled through respiratory secretions
while breathing, talking, coughing and laughing.
“Scrubs” refers to the sanitary clothing worn by the OT staff, usually comprising a
short-sleeve, v-neck shirt and loose-fitting, drawstring pants. The design of scrubs
minimizes places where contaminants can hide, and they are easy to launder. They
should be changed after a likely contamination and should always be cleaned in a
healthcare laundering facility.
Surgical attire
The surgical attire includes gloves, gowns, caps, mask, eye protection, waterproof
aprons and footwear. It protects the patient from risk of infection from the hair, skin,
clothes and respiratory secretions of the surgical team. The surgical attire also
protects the surgical team from risk of exposure to blood and tissues of the patient
during operation. (Steps for wearing the surgical attire are given in Annex 9.1.)
The sterile field
It is important to maintain a sterile field to prevent contamination of surgical incision.
x A sterile field is the area prepared around the surgical procedure site and
where the sterile instruments and other items needed during the operation are
placed.
x It is created by placing sterile towels or sterile drapes on the prepared
procedure site on the patient and includes a stand nearby.
x Only sterile objects and persons in surgical attire (scrubbed team) are allowed
within this field.
x Areas above the chest and below the waist of the scrubbed team are
considered non-sterile. Items outside and below the draped area are
considered non-sterile.
x The field is considered non-sterile if a non-sterile object or non-scrubbed
person comes within the sterile field.
Cleaning and disinfection
A clean operating environment is essential to prevent SSI. The OT is cleaned and
disinfected to prevent microbial contamination. Exogenous sources of infection
in the OT are: people, anaesthesia equipment, surfaces such as walls floors and
IPC in special units or situations 91
furniture, air and dust, instruments supplies and medications.
There should be no dust in the OT; dust settling on the sterile field can carry
microorganisms particularly in operations of long duration. Dust may be acquired
from the outside environment due to defective filtration of air. Lint-containing textiles
can be a source of dust as also floor mops. Dust particles can be reduced by good
laundry practices to reduce the formation of lint and by the use of wet vacuum on
the floor.
General principles
x Surfaces must be routinely cleaned first with detergent to remove any
foreign and organic matter. Disinfection should follow cleaning. Do not
apply disinfectant without cleaning as organic matter such as pus, blood
urine, amniotic fluid, etc. inhibits the action of the disinfectant by protecting
microorganisms. A detergent disinfectant combination solution if available can
be used for convenience.
x Spills must be cleaned immediately. Apply higher concentration of disinfectant
to the spill, then clean with detergent.
x Disposable or freshly laundered washable cloths or mops should be used with
freshly prepared solution for each task.
x OTs must be cleaned daily. This includes furniture, lights, equipment,
windowsills, ledges, scrub rooms and sinks. Thorough cleaning of the entire
OT should be done once a week.
x Wet vacuuming is the preferred method to clean the floors, wet mopping can
be done if wet vacuum is not available.
x Collections of water should be dried immediately. Leaking faucets and sinks
Box 6.1. Maintenance of the sterile field
x Place only sterile items within the sterile field.
x Open, transfer and dispense items without contaminating them.
x The outer cover of sterile items is considered unsterile and should not be placed
within the sterile field.
x Scrubbed persons should not touch non-sterile objects.
x Non-sterile items or personnel should not enter the sterile field.
x Never touch a sterile item with bare hands.
x If a sterile barrier has been made wet, is cut or torn, it is considered non-sterile.
x If there is a doubt whether the sterile field has been breached, consider it non-
sterile.
92 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
should be fixed as wet areas encourage microbial growth and can be a source
of infection.
(Cleaning procedures for OTs are given in Annex 9.2.)
Infrastructure of OTs
Location
To ensure a clean and uncontaminated environment, the OT should be located
away from patient care areas and patient traffic. For this reason, the OT is located
at a higher level, preferably on the top floor.
Components of the OT
The OT is a multifunctional area. In this area patients are received and prepared for
surgery, the operation team prepares for surgery and the actual surgical procedures
are carried out. In many hospitals in the developing world, which do not have a
CSSD, the OT may also include equipment cleaning, processing and sterilization
Box 6.2. Zones
Concept of zoning
The features of the different zones in order of their cleanliness are:
x Zone 3 is the cleanest or ultra-clean zone. It is also called the aseptic zone and
includes the OT and areas where the operation team and patient are prepared
for surgery. The areas for packaging and sterilizing surgical instruments are also
included in this zone. The different areas in this zone are physically separated
from each other. Within this zone, the cleanest is the OT where the patient’s
tissues are exposed during surgery.
• Zone 2 is the restricted zone where entry is restricted. It is the transitional area
between the outer zone and the aseptic zone. Persons entering this zone have
to change to protective clothing and footwear to prevent contamination of the
surroundings.
• Zone 1 is also called the outer zone and has similar level of cleanliness as other
patient-care areas in the hospital. It is the zone where patients are received and
administrative functions are carried out. Toilets are located in this zone.
• Zone 4 or disposal zone is a relatively dirty zone. Staff working in this area need
to wear special protective wear for their protection. There should be no movement
of staff or equipment from this zone to cleaner zones of the OT. This zone is
connected by a separate corridor (also called “dirty corridor”) leading out of the
OT.
IPC in special units or situations 93
areas. In addition, there are areas for administrative functions, sluicing and waste
disposal. The OT areas are distributed into zones depending upon the level of
sterility and cleanliness required.
Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis
• Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) should be administered before the
surgical incision when indicated (depending on the type of operation). This
should be based on the hospital antibiotic policy.
x The initial dose of prophylactic antimicrobial agent should be administered by
the intravenous route, timed such that a bactericidal concentration of the drug
is established in serum and tissues when the incision is made.
x Administration of SAP should be within 120 minutes of incision, while
considering the half-life of the antibiotic.
x Clinicians should consider the half-life and protein binding as the most
important pharmacokinetic parameters of any single SAP agent in order to
ensure adequate serum and tissue concentration at the time of incision and
during the entire surgical procedure.
x SAP should not be prolonged after the completion of the operation and is not
recommended in the presence of a wound drain for the purpose of preventing
SSI.
To reduce the stay in hospital, patients are discharged before incision has healed.
The patient should be educated as to how to take care of the incision site, personal
hygiene, about signs and symptoms of infection and whom to contact if infection
occurs (see Chapter 7 for details of SSI).
B. IPC in ICUs
Intensive care units (ICUs) house patients that are particularly vulnerable and
at five- to ten-times at higher risk of HAI. With defences compromised due to
various invasive devices such as peripheral and central lines, urinary catheters
and mechanical ventilators, they are particularly prone to device-related infections.
Intrinsic factors such as immunosuppression and comorbidities compound their
vulnerabilities. Patients in the ICU are also exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics
and are susceptible to multidrug-resistant organisms such as Acinetobacter spp.
and Pseudomonas spp. It is estimated that:73
x In high-income countries, approximately 30% of patients in ICU are affected by
at least one HAI.
94 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x In LMICs the frequency of ICU-acquired infection is at least 2–3 fold higher
than that in high-income countries; device-associated infection densities are up
to 13 times higher than those in the USA.
x Similarly, newborns admitted in NICUs are at higher risk of acquiring HAI in
developing countries, with infection rates 3 to 20 times higher than those in
high-income countries.
Patients at risk of HAI
Patient, therapy and environment-related risk factors for the development of HAI
are:74
x Age >70 years
x Shock, major trauma, acute renal failure, coma
x Prior antibiotics
x Mechanical ventilation
x Indwelling catheters
x Immunocomromised patients on steroids or chemotherapy
x Prolonged ICU stay (>3 days)
IPC practices
Standard precautions should be applied for all patients in the ICU. In addition,
transmission-based precautions should be applied to standard precautions to
prevent infections where route of transmission is known (see also Chapter 4).
Skin preparation and use of antiseptic agents
x Gross contamination at the site of incision should be removed before the
antiseptic skin preparation.
x Antiseptic skin preparation should be applied in concentric circles moving away
from the proposed incision site to the periphery; allowing sufficient prepared
area to be included.
ICU footwear
x Special well-fitting footwear with impervious soles should be worn in the ICU.
Shoes should be preferred over slippers.
x Footwear should be regularly cleaned to remove splashes of blood and body
fluids.
IPC in special units or situations 95
x The ICU footwear must not be taken out of the ICU to other areas of the
hospital.
Bundle approach to prevent device-associated infections
Since device-associated infections form a major burden of HAIs, a bundled care
approach has proven to achieve high levels of compliance with better outcomes.
What is a care bundle?
A care bundle identifies a set of key interventions deriving from evidence-based
guidelines that, when implemented, are expected to improve health outcomes of
patients. The aim of care bundles is to improve health outcomes by facilitating and
promoting changes in patient care and to encourage compliance to guidelines.75–77
Implementation of care bundles creates an important opportunity to deliver evidence-
based and safe healthcare to patients using a multimodal or multidisciplinary
approach. Training of staff is one of the most important components of a care
bundle for prevention of HAI.
Care bundles for prevention of device-associated infections are:
x Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle
x Central line-associated bloodstream infection bundle
x Catheter-associated urinary tract infection bundle
Ventilator-associated pneumonia
Pneumonia is the second most common HAI reported in the world and is
associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Most patients with healthcare-
associated pneumonia are those with extremes of age, severe underlying disease,
immunosuppression, depressed sensorium and cardiopulmonary disease, and
those who have had thoraco-abdominal surgery. Most bacterial healthcare-
associated pneumonia occur by aspiration of bacteria colonizing the oropharynx
or upper gastrointestinal tract of the patient. Intubation and mechanical ventilation
greatly increase the risk of bacterial pneumonia because they alter first-line patient
defences. Pneumonia due to infective causes occurring in a patient on mechanical
ventilation is termed ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP. (See Chapter 7 for
the current definition of VAP for surveillance.)
96 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Prevention of VAP
Preventive measures for VAP include decreasing aspiration by the patient,
preventing cross-contamination or colonization via hands of personnel, the correct
use and appropriate disinfection or sterilization of respiratory therapy devices and
staff education.
Strategies to prevent VAP are:78
1. Maintenance of in-use respiratory therapy equipment
x Fluids, nebulized or used in a humidifier should be sterile and dispensed
aseptically.
x Fluid reservoirs should be filled immediately before use. Fluid should not be
added to replenish partially filled reservoirs. Residual fluid should be discarded
and the reservoir filled with fresh fluid.
x Water that has condensed in tubing should be discarded and not allowed to
drain back into the reservoir.
x Disposable supplies such as nasal prongs, tubing, masks, ventilator and
breathing circuits are for single patient use only.
x When a respiratory therapy machine is used to treat multiple patients, the
breathing circuit must be changed between patients.
x Maintain ventilator circuits
R Change the ventilator circuit only if visibly soiled or malfunctioning.
R Changing the ventilator circuit as needed rather than on a fixed schedule
has no impact on VAP rates or patient outcomes but decreases costs.
2. Processing reusable equipment
x All equipment to be sterilized or disinfected should be thoroughly cleaned first
to remove organic material such as blood, secretions or other residue/soil.
x Respiratory therapy equipment that touches mucous membranes or is a non-
disposable part of a breathing circuit should receive high-level disinfection or
be sterilized.
x Coolant chambers for ultrasonic nebulizers are difficult to disinfect adequately
and should have at least 30 minutes contact with a high-level disinfectant or be
gas-sterilized (ethylene oxide). This is not necessary if a disposable chamber is
used.
x Hand-powered resuscitation bags that have been used for a patient should
receive high-level disinfection or be sterilized (unless disposable).
3. Suctioning of the respiratory tract
IPC in special units or situations 97
x Frequent suctioning causes excessive trauma and risk of cross-contamination.
Suctioning should be done only when needed to reduce excessive secretions.
x Suctioning should be performed using gloves on both hands and protective
eyewear and mask.
x A sterile catheter should be used for each series of suctioning (defined
as a single suctioning or repeated suctioning done with only brief periods
intervening to clear or flush the catheter).
x Catheter should be flushed with sterile fluid in case flushing is required. Fluid
that has been used for one series of suctioning should be discarded.
x Suction connecting tubing and suction canisters should be changed between
patients, and daily for ongoing patients.
x Unless disposable, suction canisters should be thoroughly cleaned to remove
organic material, then receive high-level disinfection or be sterilized.
Bundle of care for prevention of VAP79
x Elevation of the head of the bed between 30 and 45 degrees
x Peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis
x Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis unless contraindicated
x Daily mouth care with chlorhexidine
Catheter-related bloodstream infection and CLABSI
Intravascular catheters are an indispensable part of modern healthcare, but
their use puts patients at risk of local and systemic infections: local site infection,
bloodstream infection (BSI), septic thrombophlebitis, endocarditis, and other
metastatic infections.80
Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) may be caused by
cutaneous microorganisms that contaminate the catheter during insertion or migrate
along the catheter track or by microorganisms from the hands of HCWs during
interventions. The most frequently implicated organisms are: Coagulase-negative
staphylococci, particularly Staph. epidermidis. Other organisms are Staph. aureus,
Candida spp., Enterococci and Gram-negative organisms. It is essential that the
best evidence-based practices be followed for prevention of catheter related or
associated bloodstream infections (BSIs).81
Routes of contamination of catheters
There are four recognized routes for contamination of catheters:
98 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Migration of skin organisms at the insertion site into the cutaneous catheter
tract and along the surface of the catheter with colonization of the catheter tip
(most common route of infection for short-term catheters)
x Direct contamination of the catheter or catheter hub by contact with hands or
contaminated fluids or devices
x Through the bloodstream from another focus of infection
x Contaminated infusate
Types of vascular catheters
Table 6.1 gives details of various types of catheters used for venous and arterial
access.
Selection of catheter type
Central venous catheters may be made from different materials, single or multi-
lumen, medically impregnated, e.g. antimicrobial, antiseptic or heparin bonded,
cuffed and designed to be tunnelled or having totally implantable ports.
x Polytetrafluoroethylene or polyurethane catheters have been associated with
fewer infectious complications than catheters made of polyvinyl chloride or
polyethylene but there is no evidence that demonstrates conclusively that
CLABSI rates vary with different materials.
x Generally polyurethane is considered suitable for short-term use, and silicone
for long-term use.
Prevention of catheter-related infections
Strategies to prevent CLABSI are:
Education, training and staffing
x Educate HCWs regarding the indications for intravascular catheter use, proper
procedures for the insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters, and
appropriate infection control measures to prevent intravascular catheter-related
infections.
x Periodically assess knowledge of and adherence to guidelines for all personnel
involved in the insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters.
x Designate only trained personnel who demonstrate competence for the
insertion and maintenance of peripheral and central intravascular catheters.
x Ensure appropriate nursing staff levels in ICUs.
Selecting the best insertion site: peripheral catheters and midline catheters
x Use an upper extremity instead of a lower-extremity site for catheter insertion.

Replace a catheter inserted in a lower-extremity site to an upper-extremity site
as soon as possible.
x In paediatric patients, the upper or lower extremities or the scalp (in neonates
or young infants) can be used as the catheter insertion site.
Aseptic technique during catheter (CVC/umbilical) insertion
x Aseptic technique during CVC placement significantly reduces the risk of
infection.
x Strict adherence to hand decontamination and aseptic technique shall be
practised.
x Maximal sterile barrier precautions shall be used, regardless of whether the
placement takes place in the OT or ward. This should include the use of a
sterile gown, gloves, cap, mask and a sterile full body drape for insertion of
CVCs or PICCs.
x Use sterile sleeve to protect pulmonary catheters during insertion.
Skin preparation
x Prepare clean skin with an antiseptic (70% alcohol, tincture of iodine, an
iodophor or chlorhexidine gluconate) before insertion of a peripheral venous
catheter.
x Prepare clean skin with a >0.5% chlorhexidine preparation with alcohol before
insertion of a central venous catheter or peripheral arterial catheter and during
dressing changes. If there is a contraindication to chlorhexidine, use tincture of
iodine, an iodophor or 70% alcohol.
x Antiseptics should be allowed to dry according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation before placing the catheter.
Antibiotic prophylaxis
x Systemic antimicrobials should not be routinely administered before insertion
or during use of a central venous catheter to prevent catheter colonization or
CLABSI.
IPC in special units or situations 101
Care of pressure monitoring systems
x Keep all components of the pressure monitoring system (including calibration
devices and flush solution) sterile.
x Minimize the number of manipulations of and entries into the pressure
monitoring system. Use a closed-flush system (i.e. continuous flush), rather
than an open system (i.e. one that requires a syringe and stopcock) to maintain
the patency of the pressure monitoring catheters.
x When the pressure monitoring system is accessed through a diaphragm rather
than a stopcock, wipe the diaphragm with an appropriate antiseptic before
accessing the system.
x Do not administer dextrose-containing solutions or parenteral nutrition fluids
through the pressure monitoring circuit.
Types of gloves
Table 6.2 gives the types of gloves that should be used for procedures and for
catheter care.
Bundle of care for prevention of CLABSI
Insertion bundle
x Maximal sterile barrier precautions (surgical mask, sterile gloves, cap, sterile
gown, and large sterile drape).
x Skin cleaning with alcohol-based chlorhexidine (rather than iodine).
x Avoidance of the femoral vein for central venous access in adult patients; use
of subclavian rather than jugular veins.
x Dedicated staff for central line insertion and competency training/assessment.
x Standardized insertion packs.
x Availability of insertion guidelines (including indications for central line use) and
use of checklists with trained observers.
x Use of ultrasound guidance for insertion of internal jugular lines.
Maintenance bundle
x Daily review of central line necessity
x Prompt removal of unnecessary lines
x Disinfection before manipulation of the line
x Daily chlorhexidine washes (in ICU, patients >2 months)
x Disinfect catheter hubs, ports, connectors, etc. before using the catheter
x Change dressings and disinfect site with alcohol-based chlorhexidine every
5–7 days (change earlier if soiled)
102 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Replace administration sets within 96 hours (immediately if used for blood
products or lipids)
x Ensure appropriate nurse-to-patient ratio in ICU (1:2 or 1:1)
Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is usually defined as a UTI
(significant bacteriuria plus symptoms and/or signs attributable to the urinary tract
with no other identifiable source) in a patient with current urinary tract catheterization
or who has been catheterized in the past 48 hours.
Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) define
CAUTI “in patients with indwelling urethral, indwelling suprapubic, or intermittent
catheterization...by the presence of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI with
no other identified source of infection along with t103
colony-forming units (cfu)/
ml of t1 bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream
voided urine specimen from a patient whose urethral, suprapubic, or condom
catheter has been removed within the previous 48 hours.”82
(See also Chapter 7
on surveillance.)
Risk factors for CAUTI
Table 6.3 gives the risk factors for symptomatic UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria.83
Strategies for prevention of CAUTI
Catheter indications84
x Urinary catheters shall be inserted only when necessary and left in place for
as long as necessary. They should not be used solely for the convenience of
patient-care personnel.

IPC in special units or situations 103
x Avoid use of urinary catheters for the management of urinary incontinence.
x Use urinary catheters in operative patients only when necessary rather than
routinely.
x For operative patients who have an indication for an indwelling catheter,
remove the catheter as soon as possible postoperatively, preferably within
24hours, unless there are appropriate indications for continued use.
Catheter Insertion
x Thoroughly wash hands or use ABHR before inserting the catheter.
x Catheters should be inserted using aseptic technique and sterile gloves and
equipment.
x Sterile gloves, drapes, sponges, an appropriate antiseptic solution for
periurethral cleansing, and a single-use packet of lubricant jelly should be used
for insertion. The patient should be appropriately draped and sterile personal
protective equipment shall be worn by the HCW inserting the catheter
x Indwelling catheters should be properly secured after insertion to prevent
movement and urethral traction.
Urinary catheter maintenance
x Maintain a closed drainage system
x If breaks in aseptic technique, disconnection or leakage occur, the catheter and
the collecting system should be replaced using aseptic technique.
x Keep the catheter and collecting tube free from kinking. The collecting bag
should be kept below the level of bladder at all times. The collecting bag should
be emptied regularly using a separate, clean, collecting container for each
patient. Never place the drainage bag in a place that can contaminate it, e.g.
the floor

104 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Indwelling catheters or drainage bags should not be changed at routine/fixed
intervals.
x Unless clinical conditions exist (e.g. in patients with bacteriuria on catheter
removal post-urological surgery), systemic antimicrobials should not be
administered to prevent CAUTI.
x The periurethral area should not be cleaned with antiseptics to prevent CAUTI.
Routine hygiene (e.g. cleansing of meatal surface during daily bathing or
showering) is appropriate.
x Irrigation should be avoided unless obstruction is anticipated (e.g. as might
occur with bleeding after prostatic or bladder surgery); closed continuous
irrigation may be used to prevent obstruction.
x Intermittent irrigation should only be used to relieve obstruction due to clots,
mucus or other causes. A large-volume sterile syringe and sterile irrigate
should be used and then discarded. Aseptic technique shall be used. The
catheter–tubing junction should be disinfected before disconnection.
x lf the catheter becomes obstructed, it should be changed if it is likely that the
catheter is contributing to the obstruction (e.g. formation of concretions).
x Small volumes of fresh urine for examination can be obtained from the
sampling port. The port should be disinfected and urine aspirated with a sterile
needle and syringe or other collection device (e.g. vacutainer).
x Larger volumes of urine for special analyses (not culture) should be obtained
aseptically from the drainage bag.
Other issues85
x Change the drainage bag when inserting a new catheter. Also, change the
drainage bag when it becomes stained, clouded by sediment or leaks.
x Encourage fluids within limits the patient can medically tolerate. Flush the
urinary system from the inside out, the so-called "natural flush”. Normal fluid
intake should be around 2000 ml daily.
x Avoid clamping before catheter removal.

C. IPC in maternal and neonatal units
Maternal and neonatal infections
Maternal “peripartum infection” includes:
x Intrapartum (intra-amniotic infection occurring before birth) and
x Postpartum (or puerperal) bacterial infections related to childbirth
The clinical presentations of maternal infections are:
Endometritis: Infection of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) and may extend to
the myometrium (smooth muscle of the uterus). Presents as fever, pain in abdomen,
uterine tenderness, foul smelling vaginal discharge and signs of peritonitis in women
who have had caesarean section. Caesarean section is the most important factor
contributing to postpartum endometritis
106 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
SSI: Infection of the surgical site after caesarean section. May be superficial, deep
or organ-space. Postpartum SSI, wound infection and endometritis is a major cause
of prolonged hospital stay and poses a burden to the healthcare system.
Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis: Thrombosis of the deep pelvic veins due to
inflammation and blood clots. It can occur after prolonged labour, premature rupture
of membranes and difficult labour.
Infected episiotomy: This is an infection in the surgical cut which is made in the
perineum to facilitate delivery
Heathcare-associated UTIs: Usually occur after caesarean delivery
Intra-amniotic infection syndrome also referred to as amnionitis or
chorioamnionitis. This is an acute infection of the uterus and its contents (foetus,
placenta and amniotic fluid) during pregnancy. It occurs after prolonged rupture of
membranes and due to organisms present in the cervix and vagina.
Prevention of newborn and maternal infections during
deliveries
Prevention of maternal and neonatal infections during vaginal
delivery
Vaginal deliveries do not require sterile conditions of the OT but cleanliness is of
utmost importance. Particular attention should be given to having clean hands,
clean perineal area and clean umbilicus.
Factors that increase risk of infection during vaginal delivery
x Prolonged rupture of membranes (>24 hours)
x Trauma to the birth canal: lacerations of the vagina or perineum or urethral tear
x Retained placenta, necessitating manual removal of placenta or placental
fragments
x Episiotomy
x Mid-forceps delivery
x Multiple vaginal examinations (particularly by medical and nursing students)
Prevention of infection during vaginal examination
x Digital vaginal examination at intervals of four hours is recommended for
routine assessment of active first stage of labour in low-risk women.
IPC in special units or situations 107
x Clean pair of gloves should be used for each examination. Sterile gloves are
not necessary.
x The tip of the examining finger should not enter the cervical os unless the
decision has been made to induce labour.
x Student training should be limited to cases that are in active labour.
Prevention of infection before delivery
x Use clean examination gloves, wash the perineal area (vulva, perineum and
anal region) with soap and clean water.
x Use downward and backward motion while cleaning so that faecal organisms
are not introduced into the vagina.
x The anal area should be cleaned last and the wash towel discarded in a
yellow-coded container. Disinfect gloved hands by immersing in 0.5% chlorine
solution, wash gloved hands and remove gloves by inverting and discard in the
yellow-coded container.
x Perineal/pubic hair should not be shaved, hair clipper should be used if
required. Routine shaving is not recommended by WHO. Shaving has been
shown to increase the risk of infection after delivery.86
Prevention of infection during delivery
x Hand hygiene by ABHR or washing with antiseptic soap and water
meticulously up to the elbows and adhering to the seven steps of hand hygiene
x PPE: High exposure to blood and body fluid as splashes of blood and blood
tinged amniotic fluid is expected
R Gloves
– Sterile surgical gloves
– To provide protection up to the elbow, normal length gloves can be
augmented by sterile surgical sleeves that come up to the elbow (these
sleeves can be made by cutting off the fingers of a pair of sterile gloves
with a sterile scissors). The sterile sleeve can be worn on each forearm
before wearing the sterile surgical glove. Clean examination gloves for
washing the perineum.
R Sterile water-resistant gown, rubber/plastic apron
R Mask with eye shield
R Boots
x Instruments used during delivery (scissors, cord clamp, needle holder, forceps,
tissue forceps, urinary catheter, sutures, etc. should be sterile or high level
disinfected)
x The HCW receiving the baby should clean their hands by performing hand
108 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
hygiene and wear clean examination gloves. Baby should be received in a
clean towel.
x If resuscitation of the baby is required it should be done by mechanical suction.
If mouth suction is done a trap should be placed in the line.
x If manual removal of placenta is required, a fresh pair of sterile gloves should
be worn augmented by a sterile sleeve up to the elbow to avoid contaminating
the forearm with blood.
Prevention of infection after delivery
x Before removing gloves, put the placenta in a clean basin and place all blood-
stained waste in the appropriate yellow-colour coded container with lid.
x Place suture needles after use in puncture-proof sharps container.
x Before disposal of syringe and needle, flush out the syringe with 0.5% chlorine
solution and then place in puncture-proof sharps container.
x Immerse both gloved hands in 0.5% chlorine solution, rinse with water, remove
gloves by inverting. Wash hands with soap and water after removing gloves.
Prevention of infection during caesarean section
Caesarean section should be performed using all the precautions and procedures
as for surgical procedure described in Chapter 6. The WHO surgical checklist to
prevent surgical complications should be applied.
Similar to the implementation of surgical bundles to prevent SSI in non-obstetric
patients, creating patient care bundles comprising evidence-based elements in
patients who undergo caesarean section may decrease the incidence of SSI. Each
hospital has the opportunity to create its own caesarian section surgical bundle to
reduce SSI.
Procedures to prevent infection in patients undergoing caesarean section include:
x The abdomen should not be shaved prior to surgery. If required, hair clipper
should be used instead.
x The surgeon and assistant should wear a face shield or mask and goggles,
a plastic or rubber apron over the scrub-suit since splashing with blood and
blood-tinged amniotic fluid is expected.
x If there has been prolonged rupture of membranes or the caesarean section is
non-elective, then a single shot of first-generation cephalosporin or penicillin is
given intravenously, preferably just before incision rather than after the chord is
clamped. WHO recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis are given in
Table 6.4.
IPC in special units or situations 109
x The HCW receiving the infant should clean their hands by the hand hygiene
procedureas detailed in Chapter 4 and wear clean examination gloves before
handling the baby.
x The baby should be placed in a clean towel.
x Surgical gloves should be changed before manually removing the placenta,
elbow length sterile surgical gloves should be worn or use a sterile sleeve with
the normal sterile surgical glove as described above.
x If there is prolonged rupture of membranes or chorio-amnionitis is present:
R Avoid spillage of amniotic fluid into the abdominal cavity.
R Place sterile moistened pads in the paracolic gutters to absorb as much of
the amniotic fluid as possible.
R If there are large amounts of amniotic fluid spill into the abdominal cavity,
lavage the cavity with sterile isotonic saline solution.
R Avoid exploring uterine cavity unless absolutely necessary and only after
closing the uterine incision.
x In elective caesarean section, if cervix is closed and membranes were not
ruptured then dilate the cervix through vagina to allow the outflow of blood and
fluid from within the uterus after delivering the baby and removing the placenta.
Dilate the cervix with a gloved finger only once. When dilatation is completed,
change the gloves and wear a new pair of sterile surgical gloves.87
Postpartum care of the mother
x Gloves should be worn when handling perineal pads, touching vaginal
discharge or touching the episiotomy.
x Check whether the mother is voiding urine without difficulty.
x The mother should be taught to wash the perineal area with boiled water after
changing the pad or passing stool.
x It the mother is breastfeeding, she should be taught how to care for her breasts
and nipples to avoid mastitis.
x If delivery was by caesarean section, care should be taken to avoid pulmonary
problems during the postoperative period.
x Patient should be encouraged to move about frequently in bed and encouraged
to walk within 12 hours.
x If indwelling urinary catheter is inserted, precautions to prevent urinary infection
should be followed. Remove the catheter as soon as possible.
Postnatal care of the neonate
x Gloves and plastic/rubber apron should be worn while handling the neonate
110 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Table 6.4. Summary of WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of
maternal peripartum infections88
Context Recommendation
Prevention
of peripartum
infections
1. Routine perineal/pubic shaving prior to giving vaginal birth is not
recommended.
2. Digital vaginal examination at intervals of four hours is recommended
for routine assessment of active first stage of labour in low-risk
women.
3. Routine vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine during labour for the
purpose of preventing infectious morbidities is not recommended.
4. Routine vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine during labour in women
with group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization is not recommended
for prevention of early neonatal GBS infection.
5. Intrapartum antibiotic administration to women with GBS colonization
is recommended for prevention of early neonatal GBS infection.
6. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis during the second or third trimester
for all women with the aim of reducing infectious morbidity is not
recommended.

IPC in special units or situations 111
Context Recommendation
Prevention
of peripartum
infections
15. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for women with
uncomplicated vaginal birth.
16. Vaginal cleansing with povidone-iodine immediately before caesarean
section is recommended.
17. The choice of an antiseptic agent (povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine)
and its method of application for skin preparation prior to caesarean
section should be based primarily on the clinician’s experience with
that particular antiseptic agent and method of application, its cost and
local availability.
18. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for women undergoing
elective or emergency caesarean section.
• For caesarean section, prophylactic antibiotics should be given
prior to skin incision, rather than intra-operatively after umbilical
cord clamping.
• For antibiotic prophylaxis for caesarean section, a single dose
of first-generation cephalosporin or penicillin should be used in
preference to other classes of antibiotics.
Treatment of
peripartum
infection
19. A simple regimen such as ampicillin and once-daily gentamicin
is recommended as first-line antibiotics for the treatment of
chorioamnionitis.
20. A combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is recommended as
first-line antibiotics for the treatment of postpartum endometritis.
until, blood, meconium or amniotic fluid has been removed from the neonate’s
skin.
x The removal of blood and body fluids from neonate’s skin should be done
carefully using cotton swabs/soft cotton soaked in boiled warm water, followed
by drying the skin to avoid infection.
x Hand hygiene (hand washing or ABHR) should be performed before handling
the neonate.
x Bathing or washing the neonate should be done once the temperature of the
neonate has stabilized (usually by 6 hours of birth). The perineal area and
buttocks should be kept clean, by washing with soft cloth, cotton swabs soaked
in warm water after every diaper change. Using fresh swabs and separate
bowl for each wash occasion. Perform hand hygiene before and after diaper
change.
112 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Cord care:
R Perform hand hygiene before and after cord care
R Keep cord stump clean and dry
R Do not cover the cord stump with dressing or bandage
R Educate the mother to examine the stump for redness or presence of pus/
blood and to report to the clinic as soon as possible if this happens
Prevention of infection during procedures in
neonatal unit
Preparation of intravenous fluids
x Intravenous (IV) administration of fluids and drugs are a potent source of
infection for the vulnerable neonate. Outbreaks of sepsis have often implicated
IV fluids as either the source or vehicles of transmission between neonates.
Strict attention to aseptic technique is essential in the preparation and
administration of IV fluids.
x As far as possible procure base solutions such as IV glucose, saline solutions
in paediatric packings/small amounts rather than use adult packaging and
transfer into smaller aliquots. Avoid procurement of multi-dose vials as far as
possible; single use ampoules/vials are preferred.
x Have a designated area to prepare IV infusions. Clean area with a disinfectant
before a procedure.
x Gather the necessary materials (IV fluids, drugs, syringes, needles, swabs,
70% alcohol, etc.).
x Examine the IV fluid containers, ampoules and vials for expiry date, cracks,
leaks, cloudy consistency, flakes, etc.
x Perform hand hygiene either by hand washing using medicated soap followed
by drying with a single-use towel, or ABHR (it is important that hands are dry
before starting the procedure).
x Disinfect the port of IV bottles/bags with 70% alcohol immediately before
removing/adding fluids.
x Wear sterile gloves.
x Use sterile, needle/syringe for each IV fluid bottle and ampoule/ vial using the
no-touch technique during mixing of IV fluids and medications.
x Never enter IV fluids and bottles with a needle, except through a designated
port.
x Label the prepared bottle with patient’s name, registration number, date and
time of preparation.
x If need to be stored in fridge, do not refrigerate for more than 24 hours. Discard
after 24 hours in fridge and after 8 hours at room temperature.
IPC in special units or situations 113
x The improper use of multi-dose vials can be a cause and source of infection
in the neonate. (Recommendations for the use of multi-dose vials are given in
Chapter 4.)
x Strict aseptic technique to be followed during administration of IV fluids, and
closed system to be maintained at all times.
IV therapy and umbilical catheter care
Umbilical vessel catheters are frequently used in the initial management of the sick
neonate. There is increased potential of bacterial colonization as this site is non-
sterile and there is presence of devitalized cord tissue. Umbilical catheters should
be replaced by percutaneous peripheral or central venous catheters in neonates
requiring long-term access.
x Umbilical catheters should be inserted using sterile techniques.
x Umbilical catheters should only be replaced if catheter site is infected or
catheter malfunctions.
x Do not replace umbilical catheter if there are signs of CRBSI or thrombosis. In
addition, for the umbilical artery catheter, do not replace if there are signs of
vascular insufficiency.
x Clean umbilical site before insertion with appropriate disinfectant avoiding
tincture of iodine due to its potential effect on neonatal thyroid. Povidone-iodine
can be used.
x Do not use topical antibiotic or creams due to potential for fungal infection and
AMR.
x Low-dose heparin can be added to the fluid infused through umbilical arterial
catheter.
x Umbilical arterial catheters should be removed as soon as possible and not
be left in place for more than 5 days. Remove the catheter if there are signs of
vascular insufficiency in the lower limbs.
x Umbilical venous catheters should be removed as soon as possible and left in
place for not more than 14 days.
D. IPC in outpatient and emergency care
Outpatient department
Registration desk
The first point of contact for an ill patient seeking hospital care is the registration desk
114 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
of the outpatient department (OPD). Recognition of transmissible illness and moving
the infectious patients to the appropriate examination room as quickly as possible
is important. Frontline staff at the registration desk should be trained to recognize
patients showing signs and symptoms of transmissible diseases. Visual alerts and
posters indicating the signs and symptoms of transmissible diseases should be
displayed at the entrance. A short (3–5 questions)and simple questionnaire can
be given to patients at registration to facilitate rapid identification and isolation if
required. This is particular important in epidemic/pandemic situations.
Pandemic preparedness
Time and again emerging and re-emerging diseases have caused epidemic and
pandemic situations. The major international outbreaks in the last decade have
been: Swine Flu in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014 and Zika in 2016 and Nipah
in India (2018). In outbreaks of public health importance, the first point of contact
in an HCF is the OPD or the emergency department. Staff at the frontline must
be prepared to identify and transfer cases safely without disease transmission.
Preparation for all diseases should include screening and isolating potentially
infectious persons, PPE use, cleaning and disinfection and drill exercises.
x Individuals who meet criteria for highly communicable diseases requiring
isolation such as novel influenza or other emerging infections must be placed
in a private examination room as soon as possible.
x PPE kits should be available. Staff should be trained on the correct steps and
techniques to wear and remove PPE. PPE assessment includes competency
validation to ensure that participants are using PPE correctly.
x To maintain the level of competency and awareness, staff should participate in
drills. PPE skill maintenance can be included in annual competency trainings.
IPC in emergency care
The emergency department is a busy place subject to rapid patient turnover and
overcrowding; half of all admissions to the hospital are from the emergency. The
emergency department, such as the OPD, is also the frontline in response to public
health emergencies and disasters. Patients admitted through the emergency are
sicker than those who report to the OPD.
Infection prevention is a major challenge in the emergency department due to the
following:89
x High-volume of patients, many needing rapid intervention
x Patients present with undifferentiated illnesses of various types and the
condition ranges from the otherwise healthy to the critically ill.
IPC in special units or situations 115
x Acutely ill and injured patients undergoing evaluation and treatment in the
emergency department have the potential to spread communicable infectious
diseases to HCWs and other patients.
x Risk recognition and decision-making are often based on limited and changing
data
x Patients await diagnosis, intervention and decisions about further management
or discharge in close proximity of one another
IPC in emergency care has two aspects:
x Preventing the transmission of infectious diseases from ill patients to HCWs
and to other patients, and
x Reducing the risk of infection associated with receiving emergency care.
The basics of standard precautions including hand hygiene PPE, etc. should be
strictly adhered to.
E. IPC in dialysis units
Infection is the most common cause of hospitalization and the second most common
cause of mortality among haemodialysis (HD) patients, after cardiovascular
disease. HD patients are exposed to different types of infection, which include BSI
and localized infections of the vascular access, blood-borne infections (HBV, HCV
and/ or HIV) and airborne infections such as tuberculosis.90–92
Outbreaks of HCV infections in HD facilities, which occur frequently, have often been
due to poor infection control practices. Sources of infections could be contaminated
water, equipment and environmental surfaces in the treatment area and patients
with infections who pose a risk to other nearby patients.
IPC programme in the dialysis unit
Patients undergoing haemodialysis are at increased risk of HAIs. Therefore, the
IPC programme is essential for HD units. It includes multiple interventions which
are designed to reduce the risk of infection.
A doctor or a senior nurse working in the unit should be given responsibilities of IPC
activities. The role of this link person includes
x Monitoring of IPC practices
x training of new staff and ongoing training of all staff
116 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Periodic surveillance to assess risk
x Implementation of preventive bundles
It is important that this link person communicates and networks with the facility IPC
team and all members of the HD team including nurses, technicians, physicians,
housekeeping staff, and the patient/family. It is important that all members of the
HD team understand their role and are held accountable for compliance with IPC
practices.
Measures to reduce risk of infection in HD patients
In the haemodialysis setting, contact transmission plays a major role in transmission
of blood-borne pathogens. Transmission occurs via hands of HCWs, contaminated
with infected blood directly or indirectly from contaminated surfaces and equipment.93
x Standard precautions are to be used routinely on all patients and include use
of gloves, disposable plastic aprons or gown, mask (whenever needed), to
prevent contact of HCWs with blood, secretions, excretions or contaminated
items.
x Respiratory etiquette should be observed routinely.
x Patient identified with an airborne illness should be masked immediately
and separated from other patients in a single room which is preferably under
negative pressure.
x Details of standard and transmission-based precautions are given in Chapter
4. Patients and staff should be vaccinated as per the recommendations of the
national immunization programme.
x The patient and nurse must wear a mask when a catheter (not fistula or graft)
is connected or disconnected from the blood lines during dialysis.
Specific measures for IPC in dialysis units are given in Annex 5.3.
IPC for patients with blood-borne infections
Besides standard precautions, the following points should be kept in mind.
x HBsAg-positive patients should undergo dialysis in a separate room using
separate machines, equipment, instruments and supplies.
x Dialysers are discarded in biomedical waste after treatment and cannot be
reprocessed or reused.
x Staff caring for HBV patients should be HBV-immune, and cannot care for
HBV-positive and -negative patients at the same time.
IPC in special units or situations 117
Care of patients with HCV and HIV requires strict adherence to environmental IPC
practices including equipment disinfection.
Dialysis water
The patient is exposed to more than 100 litres of water during each session of
dialysis. Therefore, water must be purified and filtered. Contaminants must be
removed by deionization and reverse osmosis.
Perform bacterial culture and endotoxin assay on dialysate and reverse osmosis
water at least monthly and during outbreaks using standard quantitative methods,
as per available guidelines. Dialysate should be tested at the end of the treatment
day.
Reprocessing and reuse of dialyser sets
x Reprocessing is performed outside of the dialysis treatment area in a dedicated
room. It is the act of cleaning, testing and filling the dialyser with disinfectant
solution.
x Reuse is performed in the treatment area. It refers to verification of disinfection,
rinsing and testing to ensure the complete removal of all disinfectants, and
“reusing” the reprocessed dialyser for the designated (same) patient. Reuse
and reprocessing must follow all applicable standards.
F. IPC in immunocompromised patients
Emergence of new clinical syndromes and infections due to organisms with
antimicrobial resistance have altered the pattern of opportunistic infections. The
range of organisms that can cause infection is very broad and the infection can
progress rapidly.
The recognition of infection in immunocompromised patients particularly transplant
recipients is a challenge as the signs and symptoms of infection are suppressed and
may even be absent. Moreover, fever may be caused by non-infectious conditions
such as graft rejection, reaction to drugs which makes the diagnosis of infection
difficult.
TransplantrecipientsareatincreasedriskofHAIs,whichcanoccurduetoinadequate
engineering controls, improper systems or procedures, breaks in established
procedures, lack of monitoring for known contaminants, or inadequately trained
and educated staff. In addition to other HAIs, transplant patients may have intra-
118 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
abdominal infection among liver, small bowel, or other visceral transplant recipients.
Given the high risk of infection in transplant patients, meticulous adherence to IPC
practices is an essential requirement for the transplant unit. The unit should have
knowledgeable, well-trained staff that understands the implications of deviating
from established infection control procedures.
G. IPC practices in HCFs during epidemics/
pandemics
Hospitals and other HCFs play a critical role in national and local responses to
emergencies, such as communicable disease epidemics. Primarily, there is a
sudden surge of sick persons seeking care resulting in serious challenge to HCFs
in maintaining their services to the community and for the staff. Diagnosis and
management of patients may also be challenging as the epidemic may be due to
a new/emerging or re-emerging disease. The focus of this guidance is on IPC and
preparedness during these epidemics.
Challenges during epidemics
x Amplification of the epidemic. If the HCF has not put in place adequate
measures to prevent and control infection, it may amplify an epidemic by
spreading the infection to patients, staff and visitors. On leaving the hospital
these infected individuals may boost transmission in the community.
x Overwhelming demand for healthcare resources. Human and material
resources, including hospital space and medicines, may not be adequate to
meet the demand, particularly in the case of an epidemic lasting several weeks
or months.
x The health facility has to alter its priorities and adapt its work routines
to mount a coordinated, systemic response to a rapidly evolving, potentially
complex situation.
x Limited time to form links or strengthen partnerships. Managing an
epidemic or other emergency call for linkages between the hospital and local
health authorities, service providers and other stakeholders in the health sector
and the community. Thus, well in advance of the actual emergency, existing
partnerships should be reviewed and, if necessary, new partnerships should be
made.
IPC in special units or situations 119
Preparing HCFs for an epidemic94
x Identify the hospital’s role in the overall national and local community
response. Some hospitals may be designated by the health authorities to
receive only suspected or only confirmed cases of an epidemic disease.
x Implement IPC measures. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent
the spread of infection to hospital staff, patients and visitors. The HICC and the
hospital management should review and, if required, revise the hospital’s IPC
protocols. Additional prevention and control measures may be required to cope
with the specific nature of an epidemic (see Annex 2).
An effective infection control programme and the ability of an HCF to implement
appropriate IPC measures in normal, routine circumstances will strengthen the HCF’s
capacity to put them into practice during an epidemic situation.
x Train hospital staff. All staff members, irrespective of their individual routine
duties, need training in implementing procedures and protocols described in
the Hospital Emergency Response Plan. They must also participate in regular
drills and exercises needed to maintain a state of readiness for fulfilling their
role in the emergency.
x Develop a hospital emergency response plan
R Set up of a Hospital Emergency Coordination Centre for holding meetings
and managing the emergency response (including information and
communication)
R Develop an SOP for emergencies
R Develop protocols for patient triage (including the designation of triage
areas) and for patient traffic flow within and in the vicinity of the hospital
R Define measures to ensure the safety of hospital staff
R Maintain continuity of essential services and routine procedures
o Develop capacity needed to cope with information and communication
activities, human resource issues and logistics
x Establish an epidemic response group and action plan
R Develop an Epidemic Action Plan adapted to the specific nature of the
epidemic
R Implement measures to ensure that the hospital has the capacity to meet a
sudden increase (“surge”) in the demand for specific services, equipment or
supplies created by the emergency/epidemic
R Define the roles and responsibilities of the key departments and individuals
involved in the response
120 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
R Define the nature and magnitude of the epidemic and its likely impact on the
health system
R Identify the number and competencies of staff present or available for recall,
with emphasis on requirements for infection control and treatment of cases
R Organization of frontline services (e.g. emergency department) for triage of
patients
R Identify patient referral pathways within the hospital: reception o triage o
emergency o ward/ICU/isolation
R Mechanism of referral to other HCFs
R Mechanism of communication with and reporting to public health authorities
Annex 11 gives an outline of an Epidemic Action Plan for high-risk pathogenesis.
IPC practices
x Establish screening/surveillance for the early detection and investigation of
cases.
x Job action sheets: For all staff members describing their roles and tasks for
IPC in the epidemic situation.
x Training: Ensure that staff receive training in IPC to enhance their ability to fulfil
their roles in implementing the hospital’s emergency response.
x Define infection control precautions for triage, flow and placement of patients,
early reporting and treatment, specimen collection and transport.
x Identify the requirement of minimum supplies and infrastructure to implement
IPC measures.
Response
x Ensure that mechanisms are in place to receive and respond to operational
directions from the epidemic response group.
x Assess IPC staffing needs for the emergency (at least, a doctor and a nurse)
and work with administration to secure additional staff as required.
x Once an epidemic has started, establish active surveillance of cases (among
both in-coming patients and patients already admitted). Check case definition
on a daily basis from the public health authority.
x Monitor number of cases and clinical outcome on a daily basis.
x Ensure that the IPC policies are consistent with locally available resources.
x Reinforce standard IPC precautions and establish additional precautions if
required by the specific nature of the epidemic.
x Establish patient flow based on transmission risks and patient clinical status.
Defer or limit procedures that could facilitate spread of the infection.
IPC in special units or situations 121
x Identify mechanisms of patient referral, sample transport – ambulance, sample
packaging, reference laboratories.
x Ensure adequate protection of the hospital staff against infection and monitor
staff health status continuously. Undertake staff vaccination and prophylaxis,
training in IPC.
x Monitor IPC practices and modify policies as necessary.
x Ensure communication of messages aimed at reinforcing IPC efforts among
hospital staff, patients and visitors, and the community.
x Report and communicate with local public health authorities.
For IPC guidance on specific pandemic diseases refer to WHO documents
(influenza, Ebola).95,96
Recovery tasks
x Assess the HCF’s performance in implementing IPC plans during the
emergency and update these plans on the basis of lessons learnt.
x Implement measures to address the welfare needs of IPC staff such as leave
and psychosocial support.
x Replenish stocks of PPE and pharmaceutical products to enable the hospital to
maintain or restore routine IPC services.
Communication
Information issued by the hospital regarding risk reduction should be consistent
with the information provided by health authorities. Develop a risk communication
policy for:
x Communication within the hospital. Information about the epidemic and the
risks should be communicated to all staff as soon as an alert of an impending
emergency has been declared.
x Communication with media and general public. Information for the media
and the general public should be communicated through a single source.
x Coordination of communication activities. Communications activities
undertaken in response to an emergency should be coordinated through the
hospital’s epidemic response group and senior hospital staff.
H. IPC in clinical laboratory
The clinical laboratory is a workplace where many potential pathogens are
encountered on a daily basis. However, the laboratory can be a safe place to work if
122 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
possible risks are identified and safety and infection control protocols are followed.
Laboratory workers can minimize the risks associated with work involving these
infectious agents through the application of appropriate biosafety and containment
principles and practices.
While safe practices in the laboratory are primarily intended to prevent morbidity
due to infections in laboratory workers, laboratory-associated infections may
impact public health, leading to secondary cases in the community. For example,
household-transmission of pathogens (e.g. influenza A) is well documented.
Therefore prevention of laboratory-associated infections has an individual as well
public health impact.
General laboratory safety practices
Good personal habits, housekeeping practices and laboratory techniques can all
help ensure that the laboratory is a safe place to work.
Laboratory design and facilities
In designing a laboratory, special attention should be paid to conditions that are
known to pose safety problems. Overcrowding and too much equipment must be
avoided. Infestation with rodents and arthropods must be prevented.
Design features for biosafety
x There should be a designated area for collecting blood and other clinical
samples, physically separated from the patient waiting room and specimen
processing area.
x Hand-washing basins, with running water if possible, should be provided in
each laboratory room, preferably near the exit door.
x Ample space must be provided for the safe conduct of laboratory work and for
cleaning and maintenance.
x Walls, ceilings and floors should be coved and slip-resistant, which allow
easy cleaning, impermeable to liquids and resistant to the chemicals and
disinfectants normally used in the laboratory.
x Floors should be slip-resistant.
R Bench tops should be impervious to water and resistant to disinfectants,
acids, alkalis, organic solvents and moderate heat.
x Illumination should be adequate for all activities. Undesirable reflections and
glare should be avoided.
IPC in special units or situations 123
x Laboratory furniture should be sturdy open spaces between and under
benches, cabinets and equipment should be accessible for cleaning.
x Storage space must be adequate to hold supplies for immediate use and thus
prevent clutter on bench tops and in aisles. Additional long-term storage space,
conveniently located outside the laboratory working areas, should also be
provided.
x Space and facilities should be provided for safe handling and storage of
solvents, radioactive materials, and compressed and liquefied gases.
x Facilities for storing outer garments and personal items should be provided
outside the laboratory working area.
x Facilities for eating and drinking and for rest should be provided outside the
laboratory working area.
x Doors should have vision panels, appropriate fire ratings, and preferably be
self-closing.
x At biosafety level 2, an autoclave or other means of decontamination should be
available in appropriate proximity to the laboratory.
x Safety systems should cover fire, electrical emergencies, and emergency
shower and eyewash facilities.
x First-aid areas or rooms suitably equipped and readily accessible should be
available.
Laboratory dress code
x Laboratory coats should be fully buttoned, and must be worn by all laboratory
staff at all times in the laboratory. These coats should be left in the laboratory
when going out for lunch or breaks and when leaving the laboratory.
x Laboratory coats should be decontaminated and laundered regularly (never
taken home for laundering).
x Comfortable, water repellent closed shoes with non-skid soles should be worn
and must enclose the entire foot.
x Long, dangling jewellery is not permitted in the laboratory.
x Long hair and beards must be tied back to avoid contamination and
interference with laboratory work.
x A spare, clean laboratory coat must be available in case of a spill or an
emergency.
Good personal habits
x Wear proper attire and protective clothing as described above.
x Wash hands after entering and before leaving the laboratory.
124 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Never eat, smoke, drink, chew gum, apply cosmetics, or adjust contact lenses
while in the laboratory.
x Mouth pipetting is prohibited, instead use pipetting bulbs.
x Keep hands away from the mouth, nose, and eyes to prevent self-inoculation
with infectious agents.
x Do not put objects in mouth (such as pens, pencils or pipettes).
x Wear gloves when working with biological specimens. Change gloves when
contaminated.
x In preparing specimens, prevent aerosols and the resultant possible spread of
infectious agents by
R capping all tubes to be centrifuged prior to centrifugation;
R never open the lids of centrifuges until the centrifuge has come to a
complete stop; and
R only open specimen tubes by gently twisting the stoppers and lifting
them (sometimes holding a lint-free tissue over the stopper may prevent
aerosolization).
x Keep test request forms, registers and other paper work separate from
specimen containers since the outer surface of specimen containers may be
contaminated.
x Wipe outer surface of containers with suitable disinfectant before handling.
x Keep smear preparation area separate from other laboratory activities.
x Open containers carefully to minimize production of aerosols.
x Keep the container open only long enough to remove a portion for direct smear
preparation if not processing for culture.
Risk assessment
Risk assessment of all activities being performed in the laboratory is mandatory to
be able to manage and reduce the risks to those working in the laboratory. Risk
must be assessed taking into account the adequacy of any existing controls and
whether or not the risk is acceptable. Risk assessment involves systematically
reviewing the work to see:
x which biological agents may be present;
x identifying the hazardous characteristics of known infectious or potentially
infectious agent or material (see the classification of infective microorganism by
risk groups);
x activities in the laboratory that can result in a person’s exposure to an agent
(Table 6.5); and
x likelihood that such an exposure will cause a laboratory-associated infection
and probable consequences of such an infection.
IPC in special units or situations 125
Risk assessment guides the selection of appropriate biosafety levels and required
microbiological practices and safety equipment (primary barriers) and facility level
safeguards (secondary barriers) that can prevent laboratory-associated infections.
Table 6.6 gives detailed information on biosafety levels.
The risk assessment process should be integrated within the overall management
of laboratory services. Risk assessment can be simplified into the following steps.
Approach to risk assessment
x Identify hazards and who might be harmed (agent risk group, procedure,
facility, staff, animals).
x Evaluate the risk (agent and procedure), consider the existing controls and
assess the extent of the risks which remain.
x Mitigate the risk.
x Conduct a trial run using nonvirulent strains or simulants.
x Reassess the risk (any incidents/deviations).
x Remove gloves before handling phones, instruments or computers.
x Wear goggles and masks or face shields when splashing or spattering of
specimens is expected.
x Never store food or drinks in refrigerators or freezers containing
microorganisms or clinical specimens.
x Hand hygiene must be strictly followed especially after removing gloves and
other protective wear, before leaving the laboratory, before eating or drinking,
after using the lavatory, and when hands are visibly contaminated.
Good housekeeping practices
x Work areas should be kept free of clutter, dirty glassware and contaminated
articles such as paper towels or lint-free tissues.
x Decontaminate equipment and work benches upon entering the laboratory and
before leaving the work area with a freshly made 1:10 dilution of household
bleach.
x Clean up spills immediately and properly as per laboratory policy.
x Do not submit worksheets that have become contaminated; transfer results
and data to new worksheets before submission.
Good laboratory practices (GLP)
x Use appropriate PPE.
x Do not operate new or unfamiliar equipment until proper training and
authorization have been given.
126 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x The international biohazard warning symbol and sign must be displayed on the
doors of the rooms where microorganisms of risk Group 2 or higher risk groups
are handled.
x All persons entering the laboratory must have approval of laboratory in-charge.
x Minimize use of sharps. Sharps should be discarded in biohazard sharps
containers that are tamper-proof, puncture-proof and leak-proof, labelled and
colour-coded appropriately.
x Stocks and other cultures must be stored in a leak-proof container when work
is complete. A sealed, leak-proof container, labelled with a biohazard symbol
(Fig. 6.1), must be used to transport stocks and cultures from one room to
another.
x Cultures should be disinfected/ inactivated prior to disposal, either by chemical
disinfection or autoclaving.
x Broken glass must be handled using a forceps/tongs, not to be picked

up by laboratory personnel by hand. Broken glass must be disposed of in
appropriately colour-coded puncture-proof boxes with the biohazard symbol.
x Staff must be aware of the location of eyewash stations and showers and must
be trained on biosafety including spill management.
Procedures for taking blood specimens
x All blood should be considered potentially infectious. The following precautions
are needed when taking specimens:
R blood specimens from all patients should be collected in a separate area;
R blood should not be taken in any room normally used as a laboratory or
office; and
R protective clothing should be worn, which include a clean laboratory coat or
gown and gloves.
Handling specimens submitted to the laboratory97
x All specimens are to be received in a closed container labelled with appropriate
patient information along with duly filled specimen referral form.
x Test tube racks or trays must be used to transport specimens in the laboratory.
x Review, revise and modify the assessment – particularly if the nature of the
work changes or if developments suggest that it may no longer be valid.
In evaluating the risks, the key points to consider are the following.
x Listing of risk groups for microbiological agents that are involved (see Annex
12 for classification of risk groups);
x Pathogenicity of the agent and infectious dose;
x Potential outcome of exposure;
x Natural route of infection;
x Other routes of infection, resulting from laboratory manipulations (parenteral,
airborne, ingestion);
x Stability of the agent in the environment;
x Concentration of the agent and volume of concentrated material to be
manipulated;
x Prevalence of particular infections in the local community;
x Information available from animal studies and reports of laboratory-acquired
infections or clinical reports;
x Laboratory activity planned (sonication, aerosolization, centrifugation, etc.);
x Likelihood of infection occurring (including during normal work and in the event
of an accident);
x Risks to laboratory staff and others such as visitors, cleaners, maintenance
staff, contractors;
IPC in special units or situations 131
x Competency of laboratory staff in handling the pathogen, whether the staff is
trained to handle the pathogen/procedure in a safe manner; and
x Local availability of effective prophylaxis or therapeutic interventions.
Risks must be assessed at all sites where diagnostic testing is carried out, including
hospital wards, clinics, health centres and surgeries. If the assessments show that
risks cannot be adequately controlled, either appropriate arrangement must be
made or the specimens may be sent elsewhere for processing. SOPs must be in
place in the laboratory for any anticipated accidents or contamination. Laboratory
must also keep a record of occurrence of any accidents in the laboratory, staff
exposures, action taken and procedures put in place to prevent future occurrences.
Biosafety levels
Laboratory facilities are designated as Biosafety levels 1 to 4 based on a composite
of design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and
operational procedures required for working with agents from various risk groups.98

Fig. 6.1. Biohazard warning sign for laboratory doors
132 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
The principal hazardous characteristics of an agent are: its capability to infect and
cause disease in a susceptible human or animal host, its virulence as measured
by the severity of disease, and the availability of preventive measures and effective
treatments for the disease.
x Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) is the basic level of protection and is appropriate for
agents that are not known to cause disease in normal, healthy humans.
x Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) is appropriate for handling moderate-risk agents that
cause human disease of varying severity by ingestion or through percutaneous
or mucous membrane exposure.
x Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) is appropriate for agents with a known potential for
aerosol transmission, for agents that may cause serious and potentially lethal
infections and that are indigenous or exotic in origin.
x Exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease by
infectious aerosols, and for which no treatment is available, are restricted to
high containment laboratories that meet biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) standards
(Table 6.6).
Safety equipment
Biosafety cabinets or safety centrifuge cups must be used to minimize aerosol
hazards.99
Biosafety cabinets
These are to be used when performing procedures with high potential for producing
infectious aerosols. These include:
x Open-fronted Class I and Class II biosafety cabinets are primary barriers
that offer significant levels of protection to laboratory personnel and to the
environment when used with good microbiological techniques.
x The Class II biological safety cabinet also provides protection from external
contamination of the materials (e.g. cell cultures, microbiological stocks) being
manipulated inside the cabinet.
x The gas-tight Class III biological safety cabinet provides the highest attainable
level of protection to personnel and the environment.
IPC in special units or situations 133
• Biological safety cabinets must be validated with appropriate methods before being
taken into use.
• Recertification should take place at regular intervals, at least once a year or more
frequently when required.
Safety centrifuge cups
These are enclosed containers designed to prevent aerosols from being released
during centrifugation.
Decontamination
Steam autoclaving is the preferred method for all decontamination processes.
Materials for decontamination and disposal should be placed in containers, e.g.
autoclavable plastic bags that are colour-coded according to the Biomedical Waste
Management Rules, 2016 (amended 2018, 2019).
Handling laboratory waste
A well-managed and monitored biomedical waste management system must be
in place in the laboratory in accordance with the Biomedical Waste Management
Rules, 2016 (amended 2018, 2019).100,101
(See also Chapter 5 and Annex 8.)
A. Surveillance of healthcare-associated infections
Introduction
Surveillance of HAIs allows the health system to (i) estimate the burden of diseases
in terms of cases reported, deaths occurred and costs incurred; (ii) detect outbreaks
and emerging pathogens and pattern of resistance; and (iii) monitor the quality of
IPC measures/strategies.
Surveillance of HAIs is a basic requirement for organizing and maintaining an
effective IPC programme and to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.102
Routine HAI surveillance in HCFs should be conducted by an infection control officer
or ICN by systematically collecting patient-based, prospective, priority-directed data
that yield risk-adjusted rates of incidence. Risk-adjusted rates are controlled for
variations in the distribution of major risk factors associated with the occurrence
of an HAI event. Such rates enable comparison between units within an HCF and
between HCFs.
Types of surveillance appropriate for HAIs103
x Active surveillance. This involves systematic collection of data by a
designated trained hospital infection control professional/nurse. Information is
accumulated by using a variety of data sources within and beyond the wards.
(Passive surveillance consists of reporting of any occurrence of suspected HAI
by clinicians or ward staff nurses, and is not an efficient method to track HAIs.)
x Process and outcome surveillance. This is an audit of a practice or process
of IPC such as hand hygiene or care bundles. Outcome surveillance aims to
detect an HAI event such as BSI, UTI, etc.
7. Healthcare-associated infections and
their surveillance
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 135
x Clinical/patient-based surveillance. This involves counting of HAIs,
assessing risk factors, and monitoring patient care procedures and practices
for adherence to the principles of IPC. This also requires ward rounds and
discussion with caregivers.
x Laboratory-based surveillance. This surveillance is based solely on the
findings of laboratory studies of clinical specimens. The microbiology laboratory
also carries out studies on patterns of AMR for common isolates and new or
emerging pathogens and patterns of resistance. This information is reported to
the HICC and various clinical units of the HCF.
x Priority-directed and comprehensive surveillance. Priority-directed
surveillance, also called targeted, focused or surveillance by objectives,
focuses on specific events, processes, organisms and/or patient populations.
On the other hand, comprehensive surveillance is resource-intensive,
continuous monitoring of all patients for all HAI events and/or processes.
HAI surveillance with limited resources
In situations where no data exist and resources are limited, efforts of surveillance
should be focused on those areas which have vulnerable patients and on procedures
that are more prone to HAIs, such as surgical units, ICU, NICU, burns unit, etc.104
HCFs with limited resources and minimal trained staff should carry out the following
basic surveillance.
Process surveillance
This involves auditing certain IPC practices (e.g. hand hygiene) against a standard
such as an evidence-based practice, guideline or policy. This guidance or policy
should be available to the staff and they must have received the training according
to their role in the HCF (doctor, nurse, attendant, housekeeping, etc.).
The practices to be monitored include the following.
x Hand hygiene
x Urinary catheter insertion
x Using multi-dose vials
x Safe injection practice
x Preparation of surgical incision site
x Insertion of vascular catheter
x Waste segregation
x Handling of sharps
136 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Observational forms or checklists should be developed for each IPC practice that is
subjected to process surveillance (see Annex 13).
Outcome surveillance
This includes surveillance for HAI rates for the following common types of HAIs.
x Surgical site infection
x Urinary tract infection
x Respiratory infection
x Bloodstream infection
x Gastrointestinal infection
Prevalence survey
HCFs that have not started outcome surveillance, have limited resources and do
not have any data on HAI rates in their facility, can undertake a prevalence survey.
The staff carrying out the prevalence survey should be trained to identify existing
cases of HAIs based on signs and symptoms of infection and simplified surveillance
criteria.105
On any one day (or during a period decided by the HICC), the designated staff
should carry out a prevalence survey in a designated area of the HCF depending
upon the size of the hospital and available resources.
Data to be collected
x Clinical chart review for patients having fever and on antimicrobial therapy
(which is a sensitive indicator of HAIs).
x Review the microbiology reports if available.
x Data collected for a probable case includes patient number, age, gender,
location, associated comorbidity such as diabetes, type of infection, site and
severity of infection, investigations done for infection.
x In case of an SSI, whether surgery was performed at the hospital within the
preceding 30 days (or within 1 year if an implant was in place), the date of
surgery and type of surgery are recorded.
Denominators
x Number of patients present/admitted in the ward on that day
x For device-related HAIs: total device days of the existing patients in the ward
x Reporting and feedback
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 137
Reporting to the HICC and feedback to the wards/units is essential. This gives:
x an estimate of the burden of HAIs in the hospital;
x comparison between wards and units;
x the interventions that are needed; and
x priority for interventions.
Prevalence surveys should be repeated at specified intervals for trends and
effectiveness of interventions.
Incidence surveys
The minimum outcome incidence rates that should be calculated on a continuing
basis are SSI and device-related infections in the ICU.
Minimum requirements
x Administrative support
x Surveillance coordinator: Infection control physician/doctor or ICN in
collaboration with the link nurse from the unit/department and other clinical
members.
x Data entry and analysis. It is helpful to have a hospital information system. At
least a computer system is required to enter and analyse data.
x Microbiology laboratory: This is one of the core components of an IPC
programme. Besides an adjunct to diagnosis and treatment, the microbiology
laboratory is essential for the detection of the source and mode of transmission
of infection. This is possible only through microbiology culture and identification
and further characterization at the minimum through an antibiogram. The
laboratory also detects emerging pathogens and resistance.
Data sources
Clinical ward
x Patients who have devices inserted and undergone procedures which have
risk of infection such as indwelling vascular or urinary catheters, surgical
operations
x Record of fever and other clinical signs consistent with infection
x Antimicrobial therapy
x Laboratory tests such as microbiology cultures
x Medical and nursing chart reviews
138 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Laboratory reports
Daily review of laboratory reports may be helpful in identifying HAIs.
x Review of patients who have isolation of organisms potentially associated with
infection.
x Patterns of AMR can help in identifying issues of emerging resistance.
Laboratory reports alone cannot be relied upon for the following reasons.
x Specimens may not be appropriate
x Some pathogens may be difficult to isolate
x Isolation of an organism may represent colonization and not infection
Laboratory reports are necessary for the diagnosis of UTI, BSI and MDRO
surveillance.
Data to be collected
x Patient number, date of admission to hospital
x Demographic details and risk factors: age, gender, severity of underlying
illness, diabetes and any primary diagnosis, indwelling devices, operative
procedure, other treatments such as chemotherapy, date, type of HAI event,
microorganisms isolated and antimicrobial susceptibility.
The infections should meet the basic definition of HAI, i.e. should be detected after
48 hours (>2 calender days) of hospitalization.
Surgical site infections
SSIs are potential complications associated with any type of surgical procedure.
Although SSIs are among the most preventable HAIs, they still represent a
significant burden in terms of patient morbidity, mortality and additional costs to
health systems. SSIs are both the most frequently studied and the leading HAIs
reported from hospitals in LMICs.
The WHO report on the global burden of endemic HAI provided SSI data from
LMICs. The pooled SSI incidence was 11.8 per 100 surgical patients undergoing
surgical procedures (95% CI 8.6–16.0) and 5.6 per 100 surgical procedures (95%
CI 2.9–10.5).
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 139
Definition
SSI refers to an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the
surgery took place. SSIs can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin
only. Other SSIs are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs,
or implanted material.
SSI is also defined as an infection that occurs within 30 days after the operation and
involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision (superficial incisional) and/
or the deep soft tissue (for example, fascia, muscle) of the incision (deep incisional)
and/or any part of the anatomy (for example, organs and spaces) other than the
incision that was opened or manipulated during an operation (organ/space).
In some cases, SSI may appear up to 90 days after surgery. These are operations
involving surgical implants and these conditions are listed at the end of this chapter.
Superficial incisional SSI
x Drainage of pus from the superficial incision
x Pain, tenderness, localized swelling, redness or heat
x Positive culture from aseptically collected specimen
Deep incisional SSI
Infection appears within 30 days* of the procedure or within one year if there is an
implant or foreign body, such as prosthetic heart valve or joint prosthesis.106
x Pus discharge from the deep incision (muscle and fascial layers)
x Spontaneous dehiscence or “gaping” of wound
x Fever >38°C, localized pain or tenderness
x Positive culture from aseptically collected specimen
Organ/space SSI
Infection appears in an organ or space within 30 days* of the procedure in the
organ/space that is opened or manipulated during the operative procedure
x Purulent drainage from a drain that is placed into the organ/space.
x Organisms are identified from fluid or tissue in the organ/space by a culture.
x An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is
detected on gross anatomical or histopathological examination, or imaging test
evidence suggestive of infection.
140 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
*According to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), 30–90 days are taken as
the duration after surgical operation for the detection of deep incisional and organ space
SSI. This is dependent upon the type of operative procedure. The NHSN list of operative
procedures for which either a 30-day or 90-day duration is considered for detection of
SSI as given in Annex 13.5.
The criteria required to diagnose infection have to be uniform to accurately identify
any increase or decrease in infection. Correct identification of SSI helps us to find
out if an intervention to reduce the occurrence of SSI is effective. Uniformity also
assists in comparing SSI rates between facilities (Box 7.1).
Box 7.1. Calculation of SSI rates
x SSI rates per 100 operative procedures are calculated by dividing the number of
SSIs by the number of specific operative procedures and multiplying the result by
100.
x SSIs will be included in the numerator of a rate based on the date of procedure, not
the date of the HAI event.
x SSI rates can be calculated separately for different types of operative
procedures and stratified by the wound classification (clean, clean contaminated,
contaminated, dirty).
Classification of the surgical wound
All surgical wounds are not uniformly prone to infection.
x The type of wound influences the risk of infection.
x It also aids in finding the source of infection.
x It permits the diagnosis of infection even if culture facilities are not available.
x It helps in determining whether antibiotics are necessary.
Table 7.1 gives the classification of surgical wounds into various types based on
contamination with microorganisms and risk of infection.
Risk factors for SSI
Many factors influence surgical wound healing and determine the potential for
infection. These include patient-related and process/procedural-related variables
that affect a patient’s risk of developing an SSI.107
Risk factors for SSI are:
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 141
x Host factors
R Extremes of age
R Concurrent disease, malnutrition
R Underlying clinical condition
R Skin infections
x Surgical procedure
R Surgical category: clean, clean contaminated or dirty
R Implant or prosthesis
R Poor surgical technique
R Excessive use of diathermy
R Duration of surgical procedure
Table 7.1. Classification of surgical wounds
Class Classification Definition
Class I Clean Uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation
is encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital
or uninfected urinary tracts are not entered. In addition,
clean wounds are primarily closed and, if necessary,
drained with closed drainage. Operative incisional
wounds that follow non-penetrating (blunt) trauma should
be included in this category if they meet the criteria.
Class II Clean-
contaminated
Operative wounds in which the respiratory, alimentary,
genital or urinary tracts are entered under controlled
conditions and without unusual contamination.
Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract,
appendix, vagina and oropharynx are included in this
category, provided no evidence of infection or major
break in technique is encountered.
Class III Contaminated Open, fresh, accidental wounds. In addition, operations
with major breaks in sterile technique (for example,
open cardiac massage) or gross spillage from the
gastrointestinal tract, and incisions in which acute, non-
purulent inflammation is encountered, including necrotic
tissue without evidence of purulent drainage (e.g. dry
gangrene), are included in this category.
Class IV Dirty-infected Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue
and those that involve existing clinical infection or
perforated viscera. This definition suggests that the
organisms causing postoperative infection were present
in the operative field before the operation.
142 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
R Haemorrhage, necrosis, haematoma
R Presence of drains
x Preoperative preparation
R Inadequate skin preparation – e.g. inappropriate skin disinfectant
R Shaving the day before surgery
R Inappropriate antibiotic prophylaxis – inappropriate choice, inadequate
dose, inappropriate timing (not within 60 minutes of incision)
x OT – design, discipline, staff
R Increased traffic and movement of staff
R Inappropriate clothing
R Inadequate ventilation
R Inadequate sterilization and disinfection
R Open containers of sterile solutions
R Inadequate cleaning and “breathing time”
Data to be collected108–113
x Patient details: age, gender and location
x The severity and the extent of the infection in the patient
x The type of operation and location of the operation (surgical OT, emergency,
gynae OT, etc.)
x Classification of operation: clean, clean contaminated, contaminated, dirty
x The time period between the operation and the development of the infection
(the beginning of the operation is the time the surgical incision is made and the
end of operation is when the sponge counts are made after wound closure).
x Underlying patient status whether diabetic, infection elsewhere in the body,
other comorbidities.
x Microbiological culture: type of specimen, date, organism, antimicrobial
susceptibility.
Operated patients should be followed up for at least 30 days after the procedure.
Recommendations for the prevention of SSIs
The following recommendations are important for preparing SSIs and are based on
WHO global guidelines on the prevention of SSIs.114,115
Preoperative recommendations
x Whenever possible, efforts shall be made to identify and treat all infections
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 143
remote to the surgical site before elective operation and postpone elective
operations on patients with remote site infections until the infection has
resolved.
x Ensure adequate control of serum blood glucose levels in all diabetic patients.
x Preoperative bathing of patient by a plain or antimicrobial/medicated soap.
x Administration of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) is prior to the
surgical incision when indicated (depending on the type of operation). Various
antimicrobials have different half-lives. The timing of administration should
be within 120 minutes before incision, while considering the half-life of the
antimicrobial.
x Mechanical bowel preparation alone (without the administration of oral
antibiotics) should NOT be used in adult patients undergoing elective colorectal
surgery.
x In patients undergoing any surgical procedure, hair should either NOT be
removed or, if absolutely necessary, should only be removed with a clipper.
Shaving is strongly discouraged at all times, whether preoperatively or in the
OT.
x Patients undergoing cardiothoracic and orthopaedic surgery with known nasal
carriage of Staph. aureus should receive perioperative intranasal applications
of mupirocin 2% ointment with or without a combination of chlorhexidine (CHG)
body wash.116
x Preparation of the surgical site: alcohol-based antiseptic solutions based
on CHG for surgical site skin preparation in patients undergoing surgical
procedures (CHG is a better choice than povidone-iodine because of rapid
onset and persistent antimicrobial activity).
x Antimicrobial sealants should not be used after surgical site skin preparation
for reducing SSI.
x Enhance nutritional support for underweight patients who undergo major
surgical operations by administration of oral or enteral multiple nutrient-
enhanced nutritional formulas.
UTI
Positive urine culture limited to one-two species of organisms with 105
CFU/ml, with
or without clinical symptoms.
At least one of following factors with no other recognized cause:
x Fever (>38°C)
x Suprapubic tenderness
x Urgency
144 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Frequency
x Dysuria
Indwelling urinary catheter (IUC): A drainage tube, which is inserted into the urinary
bladder through the urethra, is left in place, and connected to a drainage bag. This
is also called a Foley catheter.
Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
CAUTI criteria: A UTI where an IUC was in place for >2 calendar days on the date
of infection, with day of catheter insertion being day 1.
Calculation of incidence
Patient-days and urinary catheter days are the denominators used to determine
incidence rates for UTI and CAUTI, respectively.
Urinary catheter days is the number of patients with a using catheter in the ICU
under surveillance each day.
Patient-day denominator is calculated as the total number of patients per day in the
ICU under surveillance.
NICUs may collect the denominator data stratified by categories of birth weight
x <1000 g;
x <1001–1500 g;
x <1501–2500 g; and
x > 2500 g.
Calculation of incidence
Data should be analysed for all UTIs combined and stratified by device association
(e.g. CAUTI vs. non-CAUTI). Incidence rates should be calculated for both total
UTIs and CAUTI, as described below.
UTI incidence rate (UTI per 1000 patient-days): divide the number of reported UTI
by the number of patient-days and then multiply by 1000.
CAUTI rate (CAUTI per 1000 urinary catheter days): divide the number of reported
CAUTI by the number of urinary catheter days and then multiply by 1000.
Respiratory infection
Respiratory symptoms with at least two of the following signs appearing during
hospitalization:
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 145
x Cough
x Purulent sputum
x New infiltrate on chest radiograph consistent with infection
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
If the patient is on mechanical ventilation and signs of infection appear after 2 days
of stability/improvement on ventilator, VAP is recognized by the following criteria:117
x Worsening oxygenation
x Temperature >38°C or <36°C, or white blood cell count t12000 cells/mm3
or
d4000cells/mm3
x Purulent respiratory secretions (>25 neutrophils and <10 squamous cells/low
power field) and positive microbiology culture of either sputum, endotracheal
aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue, protective specimen brush.
Role of quantitative microbiology culture
In the absence of purulence, quantitative or semi-quantitative microbiology culture
of respiratory secretions are required. The significant counts of organisms in the
various specimens are:
x Endotracheal aspirate >105
CFU/ml
x Bronchoalveolar lavage >104
CFU/ml
x Lung tissue >104
CFU/ml
x Protected specimen brush >103
CFU/ml
Ventilator-associated pneumonia
The definition criteria for VAP has many limitations in its differentiation from other
complications that occur in mechanically ventilated patients.
Calculation of incidence
x Device days and patient-days are used for denominators.
x Ventilator days, which are the number of patients managed with a ventilatory
device, are collected daily, at the same time each day, according to the chosen
location.
The VAP rate per 1000 ventilator days is calculated by dividing the number of VAPs
by the number of ventilator days and multiplying the result by 1000.118
146 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Septicaemia
Bloodstream Infection (BSI) – criteria
x A recognized pathogen isolated from blood culture and pathogen not related to
infection at another site.
x Symptoms and signs of septicaemia
x In patients >12 months of age: fever >38°C, chills or hypotension
x In patients <12 months of age, fever (>38°C), hypotension, hypothermia
(<36°C), apnoea, bradycardia
x And one of the following:
R Common skin commensal (coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids)
isolated from two blood cultures drawn on separate occasions on the same
day or next consecutive day.
R Common skin commensal isolated from a patient with intravascular access
device*.
R In the absence of culture positivity, positive antigen test on blood for
N. meningitidis, pneumococci, H. influenzae, group B streptococci.
*Catheter tip cultures should not be used to determine whether a patient meets the case
definition for BSI.
Vascular catheter infection
Signs of inflammation, lymphangitis or purulent discharge from the site of catheter.
Most intravascular catheters are inserted into peripheral veins for venous access
and are called peripheral vascular catheters.
CLABSI
Central lines are intravascular catheters that terminate at (or open at) the heart or
close to the heart in one of the great vessels. Central lines can be temporary or
permanent.
Temporary central lines are non-tunnelled, non-implanted lines, e.g lines which
are commonly used for acute management in ICU, peripherally inserted central
catheter lines for parenteral nutrition, etc.
Permanent central lines can be tunnelled catheters (including long-term dialysis
catheters) or implanted catheters (including ports for chemotherapy).
The following are the great vessels that define a central line:
x Aorta
x Pulmonary artery
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 147
x Superior or inferior vena cava
x Brachiocephalic vein
x Internal jugular vein
x Subclavian vein
x External and common iliac vein
x Femoral vein
x Umbilical artery/vein (in neonates)
Recognized pathogen: An organism recognized as a cause of BSI
Common commensal: An organism that can commonly exist on body surfaces
without causing disease. It is often referred to as a “contaminant” when isolated in
blood culture, e.g. coagulase-negative staphylococci and diphtheroids (Box 7.2).
Calculation of incidence rate
x Central line days: the denominator is calculated as the number of patients with
one or more temporary central lines on each unit under surveillance, each
day. Surveillance staff should record the number of patients in the surveillance
unit who have at least one central line in place. If a patient has more than one
central line in place, itis still countedonly as one central line day.
x Patient-days: the denominator is calculated as the total number of patients per
day in the unit under surveillance. Patient-days should be collected at the same
time as central linedays.
x NICU patient-days: the denominator may be stratified by categories of birth
weight:119
R <1000 g;
Box 7.2. Rules for two matching blood cultures
Samples taken at the same time:
x Should be from different sites (e.g. one from right arm and other from the left arm)
using a separate sterile needle and syringe for each blood draw
OR
x If samples taken from the same site, there must be: (i) two separate blood draws,
each using a separate sterile needle and syringe; (ii) site disinfection between
draws
Samples taken at different times:
• Second sample collection must be on the same day or next day (consecutive
days)
148 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
R <1001–1500 g;
R <1501–2500 g; and
R > 2500 g.
Calculation of incidence
BSI rate (BSI per 1000 patient-days): divide the total number of reported BSI by the
number of patient-days and then multiply by 1000.
CLABSI rate (CLABSI per 1000 central line days): divide the total number of reported
CLABSI by the number of central line days and then multiply by 1000.
Device utilization rates: the device utilization rates for central lines and ventilators
are calculated by dividing the number of days of device use by the number of
patient-days.
Gastrointestinal infection
Infectious gastroenteritis is common in paediatric and geriatric units. Diarrhoea is
defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more
frequent passage than is normal for the individual).
Diarrhoea occurring in a patient after 48 hours of admission is designated as an
HAI. There are three clinical types of diarrhoea:
x Acute watery diarrhoea – lasts several hours or days, and includes cholera
x Acute bloody diarrhoea – also called dysentery
x Persistent diarrhoea – lasts 14 days or longer
Diarrhoea in neonatal patients
Infection can begin as gastroenteritis in neonatal patients but then spread to the
bloodstream and present as septicaemia or BSI. If two sites of infection are present
in one patient it will be considered as two infections.
The rate of infectious diarrhoea is calculated as
x Number of HAI patients with diarrhoea divided by the number patient-days;
then multiply by 1000.
x Neonatal patients can be categorized according to birth weight:
R <1000 g;
R <1001–1500 g;
R <1501–2500 g; and
R > 2500 g.
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 149
Patients with multidrug-resistant organisms
Contact precautions need to be initiated in patients that present with MDRO,
including MRSA, VRE, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms. With the
exception of patients presenting with diarrhoea or bowel incontinence who can be
identified without difficulty, it may be difficult to identify patients for whom contact
precautions need to be initiated. Identification of infection/colonization with MDRO
can be attempted by:
x Identifying patients with established history of infection or colonization with
MDRO through health records
x Possible selective microbiological screening for MDRO
Environmental controls to prevent transmission of MDRO
Environmental cleaning and disinfection are very important in the emergency
department as there are multiple opportunities for contamination of environment
and patient care equipment in the emergency department.
x Patients colonized or infected with MDRO can transfer microorganisms to their
clothes, linens, guard rails, over-bed tables, blood pressure cuffs, the floor, and
many other sites in their immediate vicinity.
x Environmental contamination with MDRO can contaminate HCWs’ hands
during patient care.
x Patients can also acquire MDRO when placed in a room previously occupied
by a MDRO colonized patient due to environmental contamination.
x Frequently touched items in the emergency department such as computer
keyboards, telephones, and door handles, stethoscopes are frequently
contaminated and have the potential to transmit the contaminating MDRO, and
should be routinely disinfected.
x Non-critical* equipment (e.g. blood pressure cuffs) and environmental surfaces
(e.g. bed rails, patient furniture, floors) should be routinely cleaned and
disinfected
x Semi-critical and critical items should be high level disinfected or sterilized as
required in the CSSD or dedicated area
*See Chapter 4 for Spaulding’s classification of patient care items into non-critical, semi-
critical and critical.
Prevention of infection related to vascular access
Care bundles should be applied for prevention of catheter related infections
150 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Insertion bundle
x Hand Hygiene
x Use of the femoral vein should be avoided in adults
x Maximal sterile barrier precautions (including mask, cap, sterile gown, and
sterile gloves) should be used by the catheter inserter
x The patient should be covered with a large sterile drape. For patients older
than 2 months, a skin preparation solution containing greater than 0.5%
chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol should be applied to the
insertion site and allowed to dry before the skin is punctured.
x Checklists should be used to ensure that all steps have been followed.
Catheter care (maintenance)
x Aseptic technique should be used to prevent contamination of the catheter
system, including the use of a surgical mask for staff and patient and clean
gloves for all catheter system connect, disconnect and dressing procedures.
x The hub of the catheters can be soaked in povidone-iodine solution or wrapped
with gauze saturated with povidone-iodine solution for 5 minutes before
removing the caps.
x A fresh pair of disposable gloves should be worn for the connection procedure
(dialysis session initiation).
x After removing the cap, the hub should be wiped with CHG, alcohol or
povidone-iodine.
x The catheter hub should be connected immediately to limit exposure to air.
This procedure should also be followed at the time the patient is disconnected
at the end of dialysis session or for any other reason. Catheter manipulation
should be kept to an absolute minimum; if there are flow problems they must
be definitively addressed as quickly as possible.
Exit-site care
x The catheter exit-site dressing should be changed every 3 days (after each
HD session) if gauze/ tape, or every 7 days if transparent dressing is used in
addition to whenever the dressing is wet or soiled.
x The catheter insertion site should be cleaned/disinfected at the time of the
dressing change with CHG/alcohol or povidone-iodine solution; ointment
should be applied (povidone-iodine or triple antibiotics).
Intraoperative factors
Site preparation
x Thoroughly wash and clean the surgical site to remove gross contamination
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 151
before performing antiseptic skin preparation.
x Use an appropriate chlorhexidine-alcohol based antiseptic agent for skin
preparation.
x Apply preoperative antiseptic skin preparation in concentric circles moving
toward the periphery. The prepared area must be large enough to extend the
incision or create new incisions or drain sites, if necessary.
Other intraoperative interventions
x Drapes and gowns: Both sterile disposable non-woven or sterile, reusable
woven drapes and gowns can be used during surgical operations for
the purpose of preventing SSI. Plastic adhesive incise drapes with or
without antimicrobial properties for the purpose of preventing SSI are not
recommended.
x Use of protocols for intensive perioperative blood glucose control for both
diabetic and non-diabetic adult patients undergoing surgical procedures to
reduce the risk of SSI is suggested
x Maintenance of adequate circulating volume control/normovolaemia. Fluid
therapy should be goal directed.
x Triclosan-coated sutures are suggested independent of the type of surgery.
x Use of warming devices in the OT and during the surgical procedure for patient
body warming for reducing SSI.
x Wound protector devices are suggested in clean-contaminated, contaminated
and dirty abdominal surgical procedures for reducing SSI.
x Irrigation of the incisional wound with an aqueous PVP-I solution before closure
for preventing SSI, particularly in clean and clean-contaminated wounds.
Saline irrigation is not recommended. Antibiotic incisional wound irrigation
should not be used for preventing SSI.
x laminar airflow ventilation systems should not be used to reduce the risk of SSI
for patients undergoing total arthroplasty surgery
Postoperative factors
x A surgical incision that has been closed by primary closure should be covered
with a sterile dressing till 48 hours. An incision with delayed primary closure
or healing by second intention, the incision should be packed with a sterile
dressing. Use of an advanced dressing over a standard dressing on primarily
closed surgical wounds is not recommended.
x The wound drain should be removed when clinically indicated.
152 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
National HAI surveillance network
HCFs with adequate capacity and resources can opt to join the National HAI
Surveillance Network.120
Data collection formats for surveillance of BSI and CAUTI
and a checklist for VAP are given in Annex 13.1–13.4.
B. Management of HAI outbreaks
An outbreak is defined as an occurrence of disease at a rate greater than that
expected within a specific geographical area over a defined time period.121
In the
context of HAIs, the geographical area may be a hospital, ward, intensive care units
(ICU) or operation rooms. When there are more cases of infection with the same
organism than would normally be expected in one area or period, this constitutes an
outbreak. It is important to investigate a HAI outbreak immediately, as the availability
and quality of microbiological evidence and epidemiological data diminishes rapidly
with time between illness and investigation.
“Outbreaks” vs. “Clusters”
Sometimes small outbreaks are referred to as clusters (e.g. HBV and HCV). A
cluster is an aggregation of cases grouped with respect to person, place and time
that are suspected to be greater than the number expected.122
Functionally, there
is no major difference since both outbreaks and clusters need to be investigated
to uncover the factor(s) responsible and to guide implementation of infection
prevention and control measures (Box 7.3).
Box 7.3. “Outbreak” vs. “Pseudo-outbreak”
An “outbreak” is generally, an increase in clinical disease or clinically relevant lab
reports (e.g. dengue or HIV serology or flu PCR). A “pseudo-outbreak” is generally an
increase in reports or positive cultures without evidence of disease.
This may be a surveillance or laboratory artifact due to:
• New definitions
• Improved surveillance
• New practitioners
• New lab tests or change in testing frequency
• Poor sample collection
• Laboratory error or contamination
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 153
Commonly detected organisms in HAI outbreaks
x Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
x Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
x Multi-resistant Klebsiella sp., or Pseudomonas sp.
x Diarrhoeal pathogens (e.g. Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Campylobacter sp.,
norovirus)
x Respiratory pathogens (e.g. influenza, RSV)
There are also reports of HAI outbreaks caused due to M. tuberculosis, HBV, HCV,
HIV, HAV, HEV, etc.
Identifying a potential outbreak
An outbreak can be identified by regular reviews of surveillance and laboratory
data. Clinician reports of notifiable diseases can provide an alert to an unusual
increase in a disease. In many outbreaks due to common encountered pathogens,
comparison is made with previous occurrence of the same infection.
Some outbreaks are easy to investigate, e.g. unusual or important organisms.
Others are not that easy, e.g. a 50% increase in SSIs for one quarter or doubling
of MRSA BSIs for one month. Occurrence of any unusual organism needs to be
investigated.
There might be various modes of transmission of outbreak pathogens in healthcare
facilities (Box.7.4). Sometimes outbreaks occur in the community and the hospital
acts as an amplifier, e.g. the sick patient admitted to the hospital (index case)
transmits the infection to other patients and staff and the number of cases with
infection increase. This has happened in the outbreaks of SARS, influenza, Ebola
and Nipah virus outbreaks.
Box. 7.4. Modes of transmission of outbreak pathogens123
• Common source
• Human reservoir
• Cross-infection (person to person)
• Airborne
• Other environmental (e.g. fomite or medical device)
• Zoonotic and vector-borne
• Uncertain
154 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Outbreaks should be investigated to:
x To define the magnitude of the outbreak interms of time, place and person
x Identify the cause of the outbreak and mode of transmission
x Control the outbreak
x Prevent similar outbreaks in the future
x Evaluate existing infection prevention and control strategies
Steps involved in HAI outbreak investigation
These steps are very useful when investigating an outbreak, it is important to
remember that they are provided as a guideline. Although the steps are listed
sequentially the process of outbreak investigation may occur in a different order,
often simultaneously or repeated many times as new information is received.
1. Verification of diagnosis
2. Confirmation of the outbreak existence
3. Inform key stakeholders about the investigation
4. Construct a case definition
5. Identifying and count the number of cases and collect information
6. Examine descriptive epidemiological features of cases
7. Observations and review of patient care
8. Generate hypotheses and test hypotheses
9. Collect and test environmental samples
10.Implement control and prevention measures
11.Follow-up and communicate results (staff, patients, press, public)
Before investigating an outbreak, a thorough literature review must be done to get
a good understanding of the suspected disease and where and how to start the
investigation.
Investigating HAI outbreak may vary based on type the setting, site of infection/
disease, type of pathogen involved, etc. For example, a respiratory infection
outbreak in an intensive care unit of a hospital may require a better understanding of
a patient’s location within the hospital, history of ventilation, and receipt of respiratory
treatments/medications. In contrast, an outbreak of infections associated with an
inpatient facility may require a better understanding of vascular access type or
details about procedures/infusions received in that facility, etc.124,125
1. Verification of diagnosis
Verification of diagnosis is the first step in an outbreak investigation as sometimes
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 155
that the spurious or misinterpreted reports might give a false alarm. It is therefore
necessary to have on the spot verification of diagnosis as quickly as possible.
Commonsteps involved in verification of diagnosis in a HAI are
x Evaluating the clues
x Evaluating signs and symptoms
x Laboratory findings
x Duration of symptoms
x Suspected exposure
x Suspected virus, bacteria or toxin
x Hospital onset
2. Confirmation of the outbreak existence
Next step is to confirm if outbreak exists.This is done by review of surveillance data
or reports from clinical departments and the laboratory. Confirm that the cases
have the same disease. Confirm that the number of cases exceeds what would be
expected for the population over the specific time period (Fig. 7.1).
Laboratory confirmation
x Laboratory confirmation is required to have a definite diagnosis.
R Identifying the pathogen will help identify the potential incubation period,
which will pinpoint at what time the exposure took place.
R It is essential to test clinical specimens such as blood, urine, etc. to
determine the agent causing the illness.
R Sometimes the investigation must move forward before a definitive
diagnosis is reached.
Fig. 7.1. Distribution of cases from a surveillance system confirming an outbreak
156 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Since laboratory results can take time, do not wait for laboratory diagnosis.
x Once an agent is identified, the laboratory may be able to conduct further tests,
to “fingerprint” the agent and verify that all cases/patients are related to the
outbreak.
3. Inform key stakeholders about the investigation
x Appropriate health facility staff (clinicians, nurses, etc.)
x Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC)
x Infection control staff
x Hospital administration
x Laboratory staff with request to save all isolates that might be part of outbreak
x Notify local and national public health officials at NCDC as appropriate
4. Construct a case definition
This is one of the most important steps in identifying the cases in outbreak
investigation. Before counting cases, the investigating team must decide what to
count, that is, what to call a case by using set of standard criteria for classifying
whether a person has a particular disease, syndrome, or other health condition
called as case definition. Some case definitions, particularly those used for national
surveillance, have been developed and adopted as national standards that ensure
comparability. Using an agreed upon standard case definition ensures that every
case is equivalent, regardless of when or where it occurred, or who identified it.
Elements of a case definition include:
x Clinical criteria (signs and symptoms)
x Person, place and time criteria
x Laboratory test
Classification of case definition:126
x The suspected case. A patient with compatible clinical symptoms, but maybe
not all symptoms, and a likely epidemiological link has not yet been confirmed.
x The probable case. This means that the clinical symptoms and epidemiology
are compatible with the case definition.
x A confirmed case. This is the strongest level of certainty. A suspected
or probable case who has had a positive laboratory test for the disease.
Laboratory confirmation may not always be possible and often unavailable
early on in an investigation.
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 157
5. Identifying and count the number of cases and collect
information
With every case detected, one can gather more information about potential
exposures, personal characteristics, and the geographical extent of the potential
outbreak.
Active case finding
Case finding helps in providing more information about an outbreak and define the
exposed population. The following sources can help in case finding:127
x Microbiology data
x Infection control or surveillance records
x Discussion with clinician
x Medical records, operative notes
x Pathology reports
x Pharmacy records, such as antimicrobial usage
x Central service/supply records, CSSD registers
x Occupational health records (NSI register, vaccination records)
x Log books
x Hospital billing records
Potential risk factors or exposures
x Medications
x Procedures
x Dates of admission and discharge
x Facility locations or units
x Healthcare providers
x Host factors (age, gender, immunity)
Data collection
The data should be confidential. Any written materials containing personal identifiers
should be stored in a secure, locked location.
x Demographic information identifies who is at risk. Demographic information
that may be collected are age, gender, occupation, place of occupation and
travel history.
x Clinical information should be collected to verify that the case definition has
been met, to characterize the disease and to create an epidemic curve. This
includes the symptoms, the date of symptom onset, the severity of illness, and
lab test results.
158 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Risk factor information is dependent upon the specific outbreak and allows the
investigating team to accordingly focus on the investigation. Since it is done
in the preliminary stages of an investigation, risk factor information is usually
confined to general potential risk factors and well-established risk factors.
Data collection tool/ form
The data of each individual should be collected in a standard data collection form/
tool. These forms should be designed specifically for investigation to describe
cases and potential risk factors depending on type of infection. The tool should
be administered only by a trained investigator/or team involved in the outbreak
investigation.
6. Examine descriptive epidemiological features of cases
Descriptive epidemiology is a very important part of the investigation since it drives
all the investigation efforts and include following details:128
Who is at risk?
x Describe data by person, place and time
x Characterizes the outbreak
x Identifies the population at risk
x Provides clues about the agent, source or mode of transmission
x Provides information to begin control measures
Line-list
This is created from case data.
x Each row is a case
x Each column is a variable of interest
x Signs and symptoms, onset date
x Medications, intravenous solutions
x Invasive procedures, surgery
x Staff contact
x Host factors (e.g. age, underlying disease?)
x Lab results

Fig. 7.2. Distribution of bloodstream infection cases in a HAI outbreak reported through
surveillance in hospital “XYZ” August 2019 (N=34)
Epidemic curve
Epidemic curve is a graphic representation of the distribution of cases by time of
onset of illness.
In an epidemic
x Y-axis: Number of cases of illness
x X-axis: Date or time of illness onset
x Unit of time often based on incubation period
The epidemic curve should distinguish between confirmed and probable cases.
The shape of the epidemic curve may suggest a single point source, ongoing
transmission or an intermittent source.
The epidemic curve helps us to:
x understand the magnitude of the outbreak;
x show the time trend of the outbreak;
x define the incubation period or exposure period; and
x show the pattern of spread and highlight outliers.
Figure 7.2 shows a sample epidemic curve with distribution of cases during an
imaginary outbreak in a paediatric ICU. Observe how the outbreak investigation
and concurrent control measures help in reducing the number of new infections.
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 161
Outliers in an outbreak
This may be an early case or a late case. It may represent unrelated incident worth
examining carefully and may point directly to the source.
Describe the data by “place”
A spot map will help in identifying clustering of cases in an around a particular area
of the hospital. Before beginning the investigation, it is advisable to have a detailed
and current map of the health facility with patient flow mechanisms. If this is not
available it may be necessary to prepare such a map for the health facility/inpatient
wards or ICU.
Calculating the attack rates
These data allow the calculation of an attack rate, defined by:
x The number of people who are infected divided by the total number of people
at risk; and
x The attack rate can also be calculated stratified by relevant characteristics
such as sex, age, location or specific exposure (ventilation, catheterization,
OTs and occupational exposure).
Descriptive analysis results
At the end of descriptive analysis, It should be possible to:
x Identify group at risk: number of people affected, time of onset and place of
onset and personal characteristics.
x Tentatively identify the source and route of infection:
x This information will help to suggest the intervention so as to control
the outbreak or chances of occurrence of new cases and to take initial
precautionary measures suggested by the IPC team or HICC, such as
R Suggest and implement immediate control measures
R Review and augment standard work precautions as a rapid response
measure
R Increase frequency and efficiency of environmental cleaning
R Antibiotic restrictions
R Exclusion of cases from high risk activities
R Isolation and/or cohorting (charting and grouping) of patients
R Restricting movement of patients, staff and visitors
R Screening of patients with isolation of patients and cohorting of contacts
R Prophylactic treatment/immunization
162 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Provision of health information and advice
x Formulate a hypothesis on the type of infection (exogenous, endogenous).
7. Observations and review of patient care
Initial observations can be useful in facilitating the creation of a standard observation
tool, if needed. Clinical observations for who and what to observe are generally
driven by the line-list and may include:129
x Medication details
x Vascular access care
x Hand hygiene practices
x Adherence to isolation precautions
x Surgical practices
x Sterilization practices
x Respiratory care practices
8. Generate a hypothesis and test hypothesis
A hypothesis in the context of an outbreak investigation is an educated guess about
an association between an exposure and the outcome of interest or disease which
can be tested. Descriptive data collected in the previous step of the investigation
provide information that is very useful in the development of hypotheses.130
Any hypotheses that are generated by investigators will need to be tested to confirm
the association. Hypotheses can be tested in an analytical study, such as a case–
control study that compares exposures among case patients to hospital-matched
controls.
Comparing hypotheses with established facts such as laboratory evidence, clinical
evidence, environmental and epidemiological evidence can be helpful in guiding
more investigation when the source remains unclear or to support a hypothesis.
9. Collect and test environmental samples
Outbreaks are one of the reasons for performing environment surface sampling. This
can be a powerful and definitive aspect of an investigation. However, environmental
testing can have the following fallacies. A negative culture may mean that,
x the right samples may not have been collected;
x the methodologies may not be standardized (there may be overgrowth of
other organisms, some samples require neutralization steps to get rid of
disinfectants, etc.);
Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 163
x even using the best methods, the yield can still be low;
x the organism may have been present but is not there now;
x environmental pathogens may have adapted to low nutrition environments and
need special media to grow;
x there may be limited bacterial yield in getting the bacteria off the surface onto
the swab; and
x there may be limited yield getting the bacteria off the swab into the media.
Guidance for collection of environmental samples
x Culture should be done after the data have been received from the line-list and
observations.
x Culture should be done only of things that are likely routes of transmission
(high-touch surfaces).
x Cultureshould be guided by the epidemiology of the organism (e.g. Serratia
spp. – fluids, VRE objects/surfaces)
x Epidemiological typing of the organisms isolated using phenotypic and
genotypic methods may be performed to identify the characteristics pathogen
causing the outbreak.
10. Implement control and prevention measures
The primary goal is to stop transmission, not necessarily to find the source. Thus,
a variety of control measures should be implemented targeting various possibilities
based on initial observations.131
Few of the immediate control measures to be
implemented are given in Table 7.3.
Table 7.3. Immediate control measures for outbreak management
Type of transmission suspected Suggested action
Cross-transmission (transmission
between individuals)
Patient isolation and barrier precautions
determined by infectious agent(s)
Hand transmission Improvements in hand washing; cohorting
Airborne agent Patient isolation with appropriate ventilation
Agent present in water, water-borne
agent
Checking of water supply and all liquid
containers; use of disposable devices
Food-borne agent Elimination of the food at risk
Vector-borne agent Vector control
164 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Examples of HAI outbreak control measures
x Reinforcing hand hygiene
x Establishing barrier between infected/colonized patients and non-infected/
colonized patients
x Enhanced cleaning
x Review disinfection of environment, equipment
x Remove suspected common source(s)
x Isolation, cohorting of patients in ward/ICU
x Multi-dose medications, antiseptics, etc.
x Restrict use of antibiotics to which organism is resistant
x Close unit to new admissions till issue is resolved
11. Follow-up and communicate findings
Many times, we may have to conduct a follow-up or “definitive” investigation by
refining the case definition on initial findings to make it possible to detect the real
cases and continue surveillance efforts based on the refined case definition. If
required, modify the preventive and control measures of your findings from ongoing
surveillance or follow-up investigation to provide better epidemiological evidence
about source and mode of transmission.
Ongoing case finding and surveillance – If active surveillance is being done it should
continue, and if not, it should be initiated. Ongoing surveillance is needed to monitor
the outbreak to determine if the IPC activities are working and target areas where
they need to be directed. Another reason to conduct surveillance is to ensure that
the outbreak has not spread to new areas.
Assess infection control measures – Review the infection control measures to
determine if they need to be continued, changed or reduced.
Communicate findings
A final report of the outbreak investigation should be shared with all the key
stakeholders and HICC, which describe the outbreak, interventions and
effectiveness of measures taken, and summarize the learnings. It should also make
recommendations to prevent future occurrence.
Outbreaks are sentinel events that help us understand and confront emerging
challenges in implementing quality healthcare services. They can play an important
role in developing recommendations that improve overall patient care and provide
important opportunities for education.
Healthcare workers (HCWs) perform a wide range of activities in varying
environments that can put their health and well-being at risk of harm. The
administration of an HCF has the responsibility for the safety and health of its
employees (Box 8.1). At the same time, HCWs are also responsible for adopting
safe work practices and taking necessary precautions to mitigate the risk during the
course of their work.
Workers at risk in the healthcare environment
x Hospital staff
R Medical staff
R Cleaning staff
R Laboratory technicians
x Employees of healthcare (contractual) services
R Cleaning services
R Property management
R Environmental hygiene services: collection and disposal of healthcare
waste
8. Preventing infections among
healthcare workers
Box 8.1. Hazards in the healthcare environment
x Physical: e.g. injuries while lifting, shifting patients
x Chemical: e.g. exposure to toxic chemicals such as disinfectants
x Biological: e.g. infections transmitted in the healthcare environment
x Radiation: e.g. radiation in X-ray and radiotherapy units
x Psychological: e.g. stress due to understaffing, night shifts
x Ergonomic: e.g. backache or neck ache or eye strain due to poorly designed
seats, computer workstations
x Accidents/falls due to lack of patient safety arrangements
166 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Biological hazards
These hazards refer to organisms or organic material produced by these organisms
that are harmful to human health. These include parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi
and protein.
Major biological hazards are:
x Blood-borne infections: e.g. HBV, HCV, HIV
x Respiratory infections: e.g. influenza, TB
x Others: e.g. viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) such as Ebola virus disease (EVD)
The infections can be transmitted by:
x Percutaneous and mucocutaneous route
x Contact with body fluids or contaminated objects
x Respiratory route
Adherence to standard precautions and transmission-based precautions help in
protecting HCWs as well as patients from transmission of infection in HCFs (see
Chapter 4).
Safe work practices help in preventing exposure to hazards in the workplace. (For
special precautions during pandemic-prone diseases, see Chapter 7.)
Blood-borne infections in healthcare settings
Of the 35 million HCWs worldwide, three million experience percutaneous exposure
to blood-borne pathogens every year. Of these, there are two million exposures to
HBV, 0.9 million to HCV and 170000 to HIV. This results in 70000 HBV, 15000 HCV
and 1000 HIV infections. More than 90% of these infections occur in developing
countries.132
The challenges faced in preventing these infections are:
x Limited knowledge on transmission of infections in the workplace
x Common unsafe practices
x Lack of standardized procedures
x Inadequate supplies and use of PPE
x Lack of regulation and policy to protect HCWs from exposure
Needle-stick injury
Needle-stick injury is a cutaneous cut, scratch or puncture from a needle that was
contaminated with patient’s blood, whether or not the injury drew blood. According
Preventing infections among HCWs 167
to CDC, the risk of transmission for blood-borne infections after needle-stick injury
contaminated with infected blood is on average 6–30% for HBV, 2.7–10% for HCV
and 0.3% for HIV.132
Worldwide, the most common causes for needle-stick injury in healthcare settings
are two-handed capping of the needle after use, and unsafe collection and disposal
of sharps waste. Unsafe collection and disposal can affect not only those directly
dealing with sharps but a wide range of persons including patients, cleaning
services, visitors and the community at large.
Needle-stick injuries that carry the maximum risk of exposure to blood-borne
infections are the hollow bore needles, which is directly related to the quantity of
blood that they can carry in the lumen.
Human factors effecting safety
A number of individual factors affect a person’s performance, thus predisposing
them to error. Two factors with the greatest impact are fatigue and stress. Strong
scientific evidence links fatigue and impaired performance, making it a known risk
factor in safe practice. It is important to recognize that low levels of stress are also
counterproductive, as they can lead to boredom and failure to attend to a task with
appropriate vigilance.133
Training and education of HCWs
Training and education should be provided to all HCWs in IPC including supervisory,
managerial staff and contractual housekeeping staff. They should be taught IPC
principles, policies and procedures relevant to their work. Emphasis should be put
on safety of the worker as well as the patient. The aim is to inform and educate
HCWs about the infectious hazards they will face during their employment and their
role in minimizing the spread to others. Special attention should be given to hand
hygiene. The training should be participatory, and based on skills and competency
of HCWs.134,135
Components of education and training
Training and education should include:
x Information on modes of transmission of infectious diseases, level of
occupational risk (to reduce fear of contact with infected patients) prevention
and control
168 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Safe work practices
x Handling of PPE and clothing
x Reporting of exposure incident
x Techniques on stress management, provision of appropriate staffing levels,
shift, rotation, counselling, support and communication skills
x Regulations and policies
Safe work practice
Some key features of safe work practice are:
x Standard precautions
x Transmission-based precautions
x Hand hygiene
x PPE
x Safe injection practice
In the event of an epidemic, special isolation precautions as per directives from
public health authorities and PPE are required.
Occupational health programme
An occupational health programme is essential for an effective IPC programme and
has implications for patient safety. The components of such a programme are:
x Evaluation for general health of employees including infectious diseases at
entry, periodically as required
x Screening for vaccination for childhood communicable diseases (measles,
rubella, chickenpox, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus)
x Hepatitis B status and immunization
x Influenza vaccine, TST status
x Screening for tuberculosis
x Surveillance and management of exposure risk: hazard identification, risk
assessment and control, post-exposure management
x Education and training
Pre-employment assessment
Before being allowed to work in high-risk areas, all staff should be assessed and
offered testing and/or vaccination for specific infectious diseases. Details of medical
history, particularly for infectious diseases such as rubella, measles, mumps,
chickenpox (varicella), hepatitis B, immune disorders and skin conditions, and for
prior exposure to tuberculosis should be recorded.
Preventing infections among HCWs 169
Laboratory and other testing this should include a routine TST.
Except in cases of outbreaks, routine screening of HCWs for carrier state is not
recommended. Besides following safe work practice, HCWs can be protected from
HAIs by preventive health checkups once a year, immunization, and PEP after
accidental occupational exposure to patient’s blood and body fluids.
Occupational vaccination programme
x A vaccination policy (also for contractual staff)
x Maintenance of vaccination records
x Providing information about vaccine-preventable diseases and offering
vaccination for the same
x Modification of duties if an HCW has an infection that has a risk of transmission
during exposure-prone procedures
x Explaining the consequences of vaccine refusal
x Vaccine refusal, contraindication to vaccination and vaccine non-response may
be managed by ensuring appropriate work placements, work adjustments and
work restrictions. This should be documented.
Vaccination requirements based on risk stratification
Based on their work activities and risk of exposure to blood and body substances,
HCWs can be categorized into risk category A, B and C and pre-employment
vaccination requirements are worked out accordingly:136
Category A: High risk (direct contact with blood or body substances): doctors,
nurses, medical and nursing students, dentists, laboratory staff, maintenance
engineers who service medical equipment, CSSD staff, cleaning staff, staff
responsible for biomedical waste management.
Category B: Low risk (indirect contact with blood and body substances): at risk of
infection by airborne or droplet routes but rarely have direct contact with blood or
body substances (e.g. catering staff and ancillary staff).
Category C: Minimal risk (minimal patient contact): similar risk of exposure to
blood and body fluids as the general public, e.g. office clerical staff, gardening staff
and kitchen staff. Immunization requirements can be considered based on their
actual job requirement.
Based on this categorization, immunization requirements are considered as follows:
Hepatitis B
x HBV vaccine to risk category A, B and C
170 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x To be considered immune test for anti-HBs
x Anti-HBs >10 at any stage after vaccination indicates lifelong immunity to
hepatitis
Influenza: Provide seasonal influenza vaccine annually to risk categories A and B.
Tetanus toxoid: Can be given to risk categories A and B if no vaccination was
provided in past 6 months.
Rabies: PEP to be considered for HCWs handling rabies cases, risk category A.
Chickenpox (varicella)
x Provide vaccination to risk categories A and B, to staff working in infectious
disease (ID) wards
x HCWs can be considered immune if they have a documented medical history
of chickenpox or shingles.
Staff records
Healthcare management should maintain records of screening results and
immunizations provided, including history of vaccine-preventable disease, date
and results of serology, record of vaccine refusal. Date of giving the vaccine and
batch number, type and brand name of vaccine. Records need to be secure and
maintained in accordance with confidentiality.
Post-exposure management programme
Post-exposure management is an essential component of the IPC programme and
a policy must be in place to prevent and manage infections in HCWs.
Components of post-exposure management
x Create awareness about the reporting facility regarding sharp injuries/
exposure among the staff137
x Conduct orientation of new employees to IPC policies of the facility
x Develop specific post-exposure policies, and ensure their compliance
x Educate and train the staff on standard work precautions, risk associated with
exposure, vaccination and prophylaxis/treatment options available
x Prompt reporting and record-keeping of all occupational exposures
x Evaluation of type of exposure and risk of seroconversion involved
x Counselling and treatment of exposures, post-exposure vaccination/drugs/
immunoglobulin
x Follow-up testing
Preventing infections among HCWs 171
Steps of post-exposure management to blood-borne
infections138,139
x Exposure site should be washed with soap and water
x Prompt reporting of exposure
x Type and severity of exposure should be assessed and recorded (skin/
percutaneous/mucous membrane exposure; depth of injury, volume of blood/
body fluid/body secretions)
x Exposure source, whether known case of infection with HIV, HBV or HCV
x Vaccination status of exposed person
x Investigations for the infection status of the exposed person and the source
x Treatment/vaccination of the exposed person if required
See Annex 4 for details of post-exposure management for blood-borne infections.

Source: Adapted from Guideline for Isolation Precautions: preventing transmission of infectious agents in
healthcare settings
Infection control professionals should modify or adapt this table according to local conditions. To ensure that
appropriate empiric precautions are always implemented, hospitals must have systems in place to evaluate
patients routinely according to these criteria as part of their preadmission and admission care.
±Patients with the syndromes or conditions listed below may present with atypical signs or symptoms (e.g.
neonates and adults with pertussis may not have paroxysmal or severe cough). The clinician's index of
suspicion should be guided by the prevalence of specific conditions in the community, as well as clinical
judgement.
‡The organisms listed under the column “Potential pathogens” are not intended to represent the complete,
or even most likely, diagnoses, but rather possible aetiological agents that require additional precautions
beyond Standard Precautions until they can be ruled out.
§These pathogens include enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7, Shigella spp., hepatitis A virus,
noroviruses, rotavirus, and C. difficile.

Annex 4: Post-exposure management for blood-borne
infections, HIV, HBV and HCV
Definitionsa
Occupational exposure refers to exposure to potential blood-borne infections (HIV, HBV and
HCV) that may occur in healthcare settings during performance of work activities.
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) refers to comprehensive medical management to minimize
the risk of infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) following potential exposure to blood-
borne pathogens (HIV, HBV, HCV). This includes counselling, risk assessment, relevant
laboratory investigations based on informed consent of the source and exposed person,
first aid and depending on the risk assessment, the provision of short term (four weeks) of
antiretroviral drugs, with follow up and support.
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIVb
Eligibility for PEP
x PEP should be offered, and initiated as early as possible, to all individuals with exposure
that has the potential for HIV transmission, and ideally within 2 hours (but certainly within the
first 72 hours) of exposure and the risk evaluated as soon as possible.
x Exposures that may warrant occupational PEP include:
R Parenteral or mucous membrane exposure (splashes to the eye, nose or oral cavity)
R The following bodily fluids may pose a risk of HIV infection: blood, blood-stained saliva,
breast-milk, genital secretions and cerebrospinal, amniotic, rectal, peritoneal, synovial,
pericardial or pleural fluids.
Exposures that do not require PEP include:
x When the exposed individual is already HIV-positive
x When the source is established to be HIV-negative
x Exposure to bodily fluids that does not pose a significant risk: tears, non-blood-stained
saliva, urine and sweat.
Post-exposure prophylaxis regimen for HIV
In contrast to the earlier recommendation of two antiretroviral drugs, recent guidelines
including WHO 2014c
, WHO 2018d
, DHHS 2013e
, BHIVAf
and NACOg
prefer three
antiretroviral drugs for PEP, irrespective of the degree of exposure (irrespective of

percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure and irrespective of mild, moderate or severe
exposure).
This change was aimed at simplification of the recommendation to improve uptake and
completion rates for PEP. This shift towards recommending a three-drug regimen for
everyone was based on the availability of less toxic and better-tolerated medications, the
difficulty in evaluating the risk of drug resistance and need to simplify prescribing.
Follow up
HIV antibody testing should be done for at least 6 months post-exposure (e.g. at baseline,
6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months) to ensure no transmission has occurred.
Prophylaxis for HBV
x HCWs have a higher risk of exposure to HBV infection than the general population, hence
routine vaccination against HBV is necessary for personnel who are likely to come in contact
with blood, body fluids or sharps.
x The HBV vaccine in generally administered in a three-dose vaccine series at 0-, 1- and
6-month schedules. The vaccine should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid
muscle because gluteal injection leads to poor immunogenicity.
x The efficacy of the vaccine is >90% after the third dose in terms of formation of a protective
antibody titre.
x Test for anti-HBs titres after 1–2 months of completion of 3 doses of vaccine. A sero-
protective (adequate) level of anti-HBs is defined as t10 mlU/ml.
x Those whose anti-HBs titres are below protective titre of 10mIU/ml should repeat the 3-dose
vaccine series or be evaluated for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity.
x Approximately 50% of individuals who did not respond to the first series of the HBV vaccine
respond to the second series of the vaccine. If the HCW does not respond to the second
series, he/she should be labelled as a non-responder.
Post-exposure prophylaxis for HBVh
x If the source is HBV-positive: Appropriate and timely prophylaxis can prevent HBV
infection and subsequent development of chronic infection or liver disease. The mainstay
of PEP is hepatitis B vaccine, but in certain circumstances, hepatitis B immune globulin is
recommended in addition to vaccine for added protection.
x If the source is known or shown to be positive for HBsAg, the level of anti-HBs antibodies in
the HCW is important. If the injured HCW is immunized (anti-HBs antibodies >10 IU/ml)
– whether from vaccination or past infection they are protected, and there is no need for
hepatitis B immunoglobulin after a potential or confirmed exposure to hepatitis B.
x When a source patient is unknown, the exposed HCW should be managed as if the source
patient were HBsAg-positive.
x When indicated, immune prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably
within 24 hours.
x If the HCW is unimmunized or a non-responder (did not seroconvert to the vaccine) or has
antibody levels to HBsAg <10 IU/ml), and sustains a needle-stick injury from a patient with
evidence of chronic HBV (HBsAg-positive), they should be given HBIG (hepatitis B hyper-

immune globulin) 0.06ml/kg as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours and should
simultaneously start/reinitiate the course of HBV immunization with three doses of hepatitis
B vaccine at a different site for unimmunized/previously unfinished second hepatitis B
series. The second and third doses should be separated by at least 2 months’ interval.
x If the HCW has had two series of the HBV vaccine and was still a non-responder, they
should receive a second dose of HBIG, 1 month after the first dose.
x Following completion of three-dose vaccination series, the level of immunity (antibodies
to surface antigen, i.e. anti-HBs titres) should be checked 1–2 months later. Those whose
anti-HBs titres are <10mIU/ml should complete a second three-dose vaccine series or be
evaluated for HBsAg positivity. If HBsAg is positive after exposure, the person should be
counselled regarding the modes of prevention of HBV transmission to others and to seek
treatment for HBV.

Exposure to hepatitis C virus
x Over 60% of persons infected with HCV may develop chronic liver disease.
x Depending on whether active viral replication is occurring for HCV, the risk of transmission
after a sharps injury from an HCV-infected person varies from 3% to 10%. The routes of
infection are similar to HBV infection.
x No post-exposure therapy is available for HCV, but seroconversion (if any) must be
documented.
x The exposed HCW should be retested for HCV antibodies at 3 and 6 months with monitoring
of clinical signs and symptoms. Preferably the exposed HCW should be under the care of
a hepatologist/physician so that HCV infection if happens is detected at the earliest (liver
enzymes monitored and in case these increase that may indicate infection) and treatment
for HCV can be instituted.
x No recommendations exist regarding restriction of professional activities of HCWs with
an HCV infection. Standard precautions and other infection control practices should be
followed.
x As for HBV infection, the source person must be tested for HCV infection.
x For any occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens, counselling and appropriate
clinical and serological follow-up must be provided.
Standard guidelines for pre-test counselling or pre-test discussions for HIV, HBV and HCV
must be followed when testing the source and the HCW.

Annexes 209
Annex 5.3: Specific measures for environmental
and equipment cleaning/disinfection in
haemodialysis units
Environmental and equipment cleaning has a major role in the prevention of infection in the
HD unit.
Environmental cleaning
Thorough cleaning and disinfection of surfaces in the patient zone (chair, armrests,
bedside table top/counter, and drawer/cupboard handles) and high touch surfaces (the
exterior surfaces of the HD machine, computer screens, and keyboards) should be
performed between all patient treatments. Enough time should be provided between
treatments so that this can be done.
Details of cleaning methodology for environmental surfaces in the dialysis unit can be
obtained from APIC Guide to the Elimination of Infections in Haemodialysis.a
Equipment cleaning
Dialysis Unit equipment includes HD machines, dialysers, water supply/treatment/
distribution systems, component parts such as tubing and filters, acid and bicarbonate
concentrate solutions, and instruments including blood pressure cuff, stethoscope,
haemostats, scissors and clamps.
Infections can be caused by contamination of supplies/equipment with bloodborne
viruses and pathogenic bacteria. Cleaning and disinfection of equipment and proper
handling of reusable and disposable supplies is critical to the safety of patients in this
high-risk area.
There should be written protocols for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and equipment
in the dialysis unit. Instructions should includethe steps for careful mechanical cleaning
before disinfection. For equipment where the manufacturer has provided instructions for
disinfection and sterilization, manufacturer’s instructions should be followed.
Details on cleaning and disinfection of dialysis equipment can be obtained from APIC
Guide to the Elimination of Infections in Haemodialysisa
and CDC Recommendations for
prevention of infections among chronic haemodialysis patients.b

Annex 6: Policy for visitors and attendants
The following points should be considered for visitors and attendants.
1. Limit visitors to persons necessary for patient’s emotional well-being and care. Visitor
restrictions apply to all visitors, including staff members and their families. Visitors should
limit their movement within the facility. Visitors should not sit on hospital beds or put their
feet on beds.
2. Visitors should clean their hands with hand rub before entering and when leaving the room.
An alcohol hand rub should be available at the entrance of the facility/unit/ward, along with
a poster displaying instructions for using the hand rub.
3. Before entering the room, visitors must enquire at the nursing station for instructions and for
gown and mask, if indicated. Visitors’ bags and other belongings should be left outside the
patient area.
4. Flowers/bouquet should not be allowed in patient room.
5. The patient and the relatives must be educated about the cause, spread and prevention of
infection, if any. The need for isolation and restriction of visitors should be discussed with
them.
6. The ward nursing staff and the doctors concerned shall have the responsibility of informing
the patients’ relatives of the measures to be taken and the importance of restriction of
visitors. This should be done at the time of patients’ admission.
7. Children below 12 years should not be allowed into isolation areas. One attendant should be
allowed to stay in the ward with the patient who should be taught to practice hand hygiene
before and after touching the patient.
8. Mobile phones have the potential to transmit infection by contact. There should be a policy
on the use of mobile phones and visitors should be taught to decontaminate the phone with
a hand rub.
x Notice to be put up in visitors’ reception/waiting area: “Please do not visit your relative
or friend (the patient) if you have a cold, cough, rash or any other communicable
disease or have diarrhoea or vomiting within the last 48 hours.”
x Notice to be put up in the patients’ room: “While you are visiting the hospital please do
not use the patients’ toilets. There are separate toilets for visitors.”

pressure indicators indicate that the required time, temperature and pressure were reached
during the autoclave process. If for any reasons, time temperature or pressure indicator
indicates that the required temperature, pressure or residence time was not reached,
the entire load of medical waste must be autoclaved again until the proper temperature,
pressure and residence time were achieved.
4. Recording of operational parameters: Each autoclave shall have graphic or computer
recording devices which will automatically and continuously monitor and record dates, time
of day, load identification number and operating parameters throughout the entire length of
the autoclave cycle.

one shall be used as a control and left at room temperature, and three shall be placed in
222 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
the approximate centre of three containers with the waste. Personal protective equipment
(gloves, face mask and coveralls) shall be used when opening containers for the purpose
of placing the biological indicators. At least one of the containers with a biological indicator
should be placed in the most difficult location for steam to penetrate, generally the bottom
centre of the waste pile. The occupier or operator shall conduct this test three consecutive
times to define the minimum operating conditions. The temperature, pressure and residence
time at which all biological indicator vials or strips for three consecutive tests show complete
inactivation of the spores shall define the minimum operating conditions for the autoclave.
After determining the minimum temperature, pressure and residence time, the occupier or
operator of a common biomedical waste treatment facility shall conduct this test once in
three months and records in this regard shall be maintained.
6. Routine test: A chemical indicator strip or tape that changes colour when a certain
temperature is reached can be used to verify that a specific temperature has been achieved.
It may be necessary to use more than one strip over the waste package at different locations
to ensure that the inner content of the package has been adequately autoclaved. The
occupier or operator of a common biomedical waste treatment facility shall conduct this test
during autoclaving of each batch and records in this regard shall be maintained.
7. Spore testing: The autoclave should completely and consistently kill the approved biological
indicator at the maximum design capacity of each autoclave unit. Biological indicator for
autoclave shall be Bacillus stearothermophilus spores using vials or spore strips; with at
least 1×106
spores. Under no circumstances will an autoclave have minimum operating
parameters less than a residence time of 30 minutes, a temperature less than 121°C or
a pressure less than 15 psi. The occupier or operator of a common bio medical waste
treatment and disposal facility shall conduct this test at least once in every week and records
in this regard shall be maintained.
4. Standards of microwaving
1. Microwave treatment shall not be used for cytotoxic, hazardous or radioactive wastes,
contaminated animal carcasses, body parts and large metal items.
2. The microwave system shall comply with the efficacy test or routine tests and a performance
guarantee may be provided by the supplier before operation of the limit.
3. The microwave should completely and consistently kill the bacteria and other pathogenic
organisms that are ensured by approved biological indicator at the maximum design
capacity of each microwave unit. Biological indicators for microwave shall be Bacillus
atrophaeusspores using vials or spore strips with at least 1x104
sporesper detachable strip.
The biological indicator shall be placed with waste and exposed to same conditions as the
waste during a normal treatment cycle.
5. Standards for deep burial
1. A pit or trench should be dug about two meters deep. It should be half-filled with waste, then
covered with lime within 50 cm of the surface, before filling the rest of the pit with soil.
2. It must be ensured that animals do not have any access to burial sites. Covers of galvanized
iron or wire meshes may be used.
Annexes 223
3. On each occasion, when wastes are added to the pit, a layer of 10 cm of soil shall be added
to cover the wastes.
4. Burial must be performed under close and dedicated supervision.
5. The deep burial site should be relatively impermeable and no shallow well should be close
to the site.
6. The pits should be distant from habitation, and located so as to ensure that no contamination
occurs to surface water or ground water. The area should not be prone to flooding or
erosion.
7. The location of the deep burial site shall be authorised by the prescribed authority.
8. The institution shall maintain a record of all pits used for deep burial.
9. The ground water table level should be a minimum of six meters below the lower level of
deep burial pit.
6. Standards for efficacy of chemical disinfection
Microbial inactivation efficacy is equated to “Log10 kill” which is defined as the difference
between the logarithms of number of test microorganisms before and after chemical
treatment. Chemical disinfection methods shall demonstrate a 4 Log10 reduction or greater
for Bacillus Subtilis (ATCC 19659) in chemical treatment systems.
7. Standards for dry heat sterilization
Waste sharps can be treated by dry heat sterilization at a temperature not less than 185°C,
at least for a residence period of 150 minutes in each cycle, which sterilization period of 90
minutes. There should be automatic recording system to monitor operating parameters.
1. Validation test for sharps sterilization unit
• Waste sharps sterilization unit should completely and consistently kill the biological
indicator Bacillus stearothermophillus or Bacillus atropheausspores using vials with at
least log106
spores per ml. The test shall be carried out once in three months
2. Routine test
• A chemical indicator strip or tape that changes colour when a certain temperature is
reached can be used to verify that a specific temperature has been achieved. It may be
necessary to use more than one strip over the waste to ensure that the inner content of
the sharps has been adequately disinfected. This test shall be performed once in week
and records in this regard shall be maintained.
8. Standards for liquid waste

Annex 9: The operation theatre – preparation for surgery
9.1. Surgical attire
Function of the various items of surgical attire
Gloves: Protect the patient from organisms on the surgeon’s hand and also protects the
surgeon from contact with the blood and tissues of the patient.
Gown and waterproof apron: Protects the patient from organisms on the body surface and
clothes of the surgical team and protects the clothes and body surface of the surgeon from
the blood and tissues of the patient.
Mask: Protects the patient against microorganisms expelled during breathing, talking,
laughing and coughing. It also protects the surgeon (the mouth and nose) from splashes of
blood and secretions.
Eye protection or visors, these protect the eyes of the surgeon from splashes of blood and
secretions.
Cap: Protects the patient from organisms shed from the hair and skin of the surgeon, should
cover all the hair
Footwear; these should be made of sturdy, washable material with closed toes to protect
the feet from splashes, and injury due to falling instrument If footwear are not available shoe
covers can be worn. These are disposable or reusable.
Before entering the operation room, don the cap, face mask and eyewear. Some masks
come with eye protection; however, these may not be available in resource limited settings.
A simple method of making a mask with eye protection is by stapling or fixing a plastic
transparent sheet to the mask so that when the mask is worn, the transparent sheet forms a
shield in front of the eyes.
The steps of surgical scrub
1. The scrubbing facility: tap and sink
2. Remove rings, watch and bracelets.
3. Clean the fingernails.
4. Starting with the fingers, apply soap/antiseptic to all surfaces of hands.
5. Rub between fingers.
6. Continue to apply soap/antiseptic till the elbow.
7. Starting with fingers, rinse each hand and arm till the elbow with the hands above the level
of the elbow.
8. Dry with a sterile towel beginning with the fingers and till the elbow.
9. Keep the scrubbed hands above the waist level.
Wearing the gown
The sterile gown is worn after surgical scrub. The gown should ideally be made of a
waterproof material. If a waterproof gown is not available, a waterproof apron has to be worn
under the gown.
230 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x An assistant opens the sterile pack containing sterile gown (the sterile gown is folded inside
out.
x Lift folded gown from pack, Stepping away from the table, locate neckband and grasp front
of gown below the neckband.
x Allow the gown to unfold keeping inside of gown towards the body.
Note: Do not touch outside of gown with bare hands. The outside of the gown is the sterile
surface.
x With hands at shoulder level, slip both arms into armholes simultaneously.
x The assistant brings the gown over the shoulders by touching the inside of the gown at the
arm seams.
Gloves
After wearing the sterile gown, the sterile gloves are worn. Sterile surgical gloves should be
worn in the following way.
x The outer package of gloves is opened by the assistant without touching the inner wrapper.
x Open inner glove wrapper exposing the cuffed gloves with palm up.
x Pick up one glove by the cuff touching only the inner portion of the cuff.
x While holding cuff in one hand with the fingers pointing downwards, slip other hand into the
glove. Pick up the second glove by sliding the fingers of the gloved hand under the cuff of
the second glove.
x Do not contaminate the gloved hand with the ungloved hand as the second glove is being
put on. Keep hands at waist level in front of body with fingers clasped.
Removing the gloves
Important: After the surgical procedure the first thing to do is to remove the gloves
Do not allow the outside of the used glove to touch your skin.
x The gloves should be removed before touching anything.
x Rinse gloved hands in a disinfectant solution to remove blood and body fluids.
x Partly pull off one of the gloves by grasping it near the cuff.
x Keeping the first glove partly on, remove the second glove partly to avoid touching the outer
surface of either glove.
x Both gloves are now turned partially inside out and can together be removed completely
while avoiding touching the outside of the glove with bare hands.
x Wash hands after removing gloves, since gloves may contain nicks and tears which could
allow blood and body fluids to contaminate the hands.
9.2. Cleaning of operation theatre
Daily cleaning procedure
x Before start of the first case, at least one hour before:
R Damp dust with detergent–disinfectant all equipment, furniture and lights
R Wipe surgical light reflector again with 70% alcohol to remove the film left by the
detergent
Annexes 231
x Between cases:
R Place soiled towels, drapes and gowns in a clean laundry bag and send to laundry. Wet
linen should be placed in plastic container so that bacteria do not pass through the moist
material.
R Soiled instruments must be placed in disinfectant and then send to the cleaning area, this
prevents occupational hazard to the cleaner.
R Wipe all used equipment, furniture and lights.
R Move operating table to one side and wet vacuum or wet mop a 3–4 feet area around the
operating site.
R Empty suction bottle and wash the suction bottle and tubing with detergent–disinfectant.
Best is disposable suction bottle.
x Terminal daily cleaning after scheduled cases are over:
R Remove all portable equipment from the room
R Wipe windowsills, overhead lights, equipment, furniture and waste containers with a cloth
soaked in detergent disinfectant solution.
R Wet vacuum or wet mop the entire floor area
R Clean and disinfect the wheels/castors
R Restock unsterile supplies
R Check levels and dates of all sterile supplies and restock
R Clean the air-conditioning grills
R Clean scrub sinks with scouring powder
R Empty all shelves, wipe with detergent–disinfectant and dry them before replacing the
supplies.
Weekly general cleaning procedure
x Remove all portable equipment. Clean lights and fixtures with detergent disinfectant solution
and cloth.
x Clean doors hinges and facings and rinse with solution.
x Wipe down the walls with a mop soaked in detergent disinfectant solution.
x Scrub the floor with floor cleaning machine and a phenol disinfectant detergent solution. Use
a wet vacuum to pick up the fluid.
x Replace clean portable equipment, clean wheels and castors by rolling them across a towel
saturated with detergent disinfectant.
x Wash and dry all furniture and equipment including
R Operating room table
R Suction holders
R Foot and sitting stools
R IV stands and all other stands
R X-ray view boxes
R All tables
R Tubing to oxygen tanks
R Waste containers and buckets
Note: Thorough washing and cleaning is essential. Fumigation and fogging have no role in
the modern operation room. Fumigation with formalin is hazardous to persons and should
not be done. It can also harm sensitive equipment.
232 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Annex 10: Ventilation and design requirements
Ventilation and design requirements of the operation theatre are:#
x Airborne bacteria originate primarily from the skin of persons in the operation theatre (OT).
The bacteria carried on the skin reach the air through skin scales, which are constantly
being shed by the persons in the room. After remaining suspended in the air, the skin
scales carrying bacteria settle on various surfaces, equipment and on the floor of the OT.
Appropriately circulated clean filtered air will remove airborne organisms.
x Air should be circulated by positive pressure through high efficiency particulate air (HEPA)
filters. These are special filters, which can remove particles greater than 0.3 micron. Bacteria
will be removed, as the size of bacteria is 0.5–1 micron. HEPA filters should be monitored
for efficiency on a regular basis and changed when required.
x The ventilation rate is expressed as the number of air changes per hour. For an OT, the
recommended ventilation rate is 20 air changes per hour.
x To prevent contamination of the clean zones, the direction of airflow should be from the
ultra-clean or aseptic zone to less clean zones in order of their cleanliness (see the concept
of zoning). This is achieved by an appropriate pressure gradient. Highest positive pressure
is maintained in the ultra-clean areas. The higher pressure allows air to flow to less clean
areas around the doors and openings and prevents the entry of air from the less clean area.
x Within the rooms air inlets should be at high level and outlets at low level so that the clean
air moves downwards through the room and towards the contaminated floor where it is
exhausted through the outlet.
x The temperature in the OT should be between 18 and 24°C. The room should have central
air-conditioning. Window air conditioners are a source of contamination and have no place in
an OT.
x The surfaces of floors and walls of the OT should be as hard, non-porous and smooth as
possible. Ceramic tiles are not ideal because the grouting between the tiles can harbour
microorganisms. There should be no cracks and crevices since cracks and crevices can
harbour microorganisms and cannot be cleaned properly. A special paint called epoxy paint
is particularly suitable for the walls of the OT. The joint between the walls and floor should
be curved for easy cleaning.
x The operation table should be placed away from the entrance.
x The openings should be fitted with swing doors.
x Since people are the main source of airborne contamination, the number of persons in the
OT should be kept to a minimum. Opening and closing of doors should be avoided as this
interferes with the direction of airflow.
Note: It is evident that older hospitals and some hospitals in India may not be able to achieve
these standards. However, the principles underlying these standards should always be kept
in view whenever new facility is designed and renovations should attempt to achieve these
standards.

Risk Group 1 (no or low individual and community risk): A microorganism that is unlikely
to cause human or animal disease.
Risk Group 2 (moderate individual risk, low community risk): A pathogen that can cause
human or animal disease but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to laboratory workers,
the community, livestock or the environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious
infection, but effective treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of
spread of infection is limited.
Risk Group 3 (high individual risk, low community risk): A pathogen that usually causes
serious human or animal disease but does not ordinarily spread from one infected
individual to another. Effective treatment and preventive measures are available.
Risk Group 4 (high individual and community risk): A pathogen that usually causes
serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmitted from one individual
to another, directly or indirectly. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not
usually available.
