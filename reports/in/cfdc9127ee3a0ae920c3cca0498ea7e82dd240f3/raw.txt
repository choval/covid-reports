NOVEL CORONAVIRUS
th
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), a pandemic that
affected 114 countries, and infected close to 120,000 people and caused 4000 deaths worldwide.

these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between
people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the
impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). This disease has become
pandemic because it has caused illness, also resulting in death in some cases, have a sustained
person-to-person spread and a worldwide community spread is detected with more and more
