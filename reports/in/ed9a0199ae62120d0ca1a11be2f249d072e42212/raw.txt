What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is a disease caused by
the “novel corona virus”. Common
symptoms are:
Fever


Dry cough


Breathing difficulty


Some patients also have

 aches and pains,
nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
diarrhoea
About 80% of confirmed cases recover from the disease
without any serious complications. However, one out
of every six people who gets COVID-19 can become
seriously ill* and develop difficulty in breathing. In more
severe cases, infection can cause severe pneumonia
and other complications which can be treated only at
higher level facilities (District Hospitals and above). In a
few cases it may even cause death.
How does COVID-19 spread?
COVID-19 spreads mainly by droplets produced


as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19
infected person. This can happen in two ways:
Direct close contact:

 one can get the infection
by being in close contact with COVID-19
patients (within one Metre of the infected
person), especially if they do not cover their
face when coughing or sneezing.
Indirect contact:

 the droplets survive on
surfaces and clothes for many days. Therefore,
touching any such infected surface or cloth
and then touching one’s mouth, nose or eyes
can transmit the disease.
The incubation period of COVID 19 (time between


getting the infection and showing symptoms) is
1 to 14 days
Some people with the infection, but without any


serious symptoms can also spread the disease.
As a key member of the primary health care team, we want you and your family to
be safe. Following the advice in this document will help you in staying safe.
As you know a new respiratory disease called COVID-19 is spreading across the world. India has
also reported cases from states and the government is trying to contain the spread of the disease.
As an important frontline worker, you play a major role in preventing its spread.
Your Role as a Frontline Worker is two-fold:
1. Spread key messages in the community about measures to prevent the infection.
2. Take actions for early detection and referral of suspected COVID-19 cases.

2. What to do if you are having symptoms or have travelled to
other countries or states in past two weeks?
� Symptoms of COVID 19 and seasonal respiratory illness (common cold/flu) are
similar. All people with these symptoms may not have COVID 19.
� Following persons should be quarantined for 14 days at home as a precaution:
People who have travelled to COVID 19 affected countries/areas in past 14


days
Those who have come in close contact with a suspected/confirmed COVID


19 patient
Those who develop symptoms


� These persons should inform you. If symptoms become severe then the person
should visit a health facility after speaking with you.
Your role in early detection and referral
� As a community worker you may be asked to prepare a line list of all people who
have travelled to other countries or other states inside India in last 14 days:
Share their names with your Medical Officer at PHC but not with others


Teach them Home Quarantine for next 14 days


Tell them to monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19


Tell them to inform you if symptoms develop and call the COVID 19 Helpline


� Instructions for the person being Home Quarantined
Stay in a separate room at home, if possible with an attached/separate toilet. Try


to maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from others
Wear a mask at all times. If masks are not available, take a clean cotton cloth , fold


it into a double layer and tie it on your face to cover your nose and mouth
Use separate dishes, towels, bedding etc. which should be cleaned separately


The surfaces such as floor, table tops, chairs, door handles etc. should be cleaned

How to take care of yourself and carry on with your duties as a frontline worker?
Take all preventive measures

 that you are talking about in the community such as keeping safe
distance, washing hands frequently including before and after home visits. Carry your own soap
if necessary
If you are visiting or

 accompanying a suspected case to any health facility, make sure to cover
both your mouth and nose with folded cloth or mask.
If you are conducting community meetings or supporting outreach sessions the

 groups should
not be larger than 10-12 people.
Maintaining safe distances for those living in crowded areas or the homeless is going to be difficult.


Even then you should inform them about preventive measures and support them as required.
Self-monitor

 for signs of illness and report to the Medical Officer, immediately if any symptoms
develop.
Ensure that you continue to undertake tasks

 related to care of pregnant women,
newborns and sick children, Post Natal Care, Breastfeeding and Nutritional Counselling, TB
and NCD patient follow up while taking preventive measures.
Remember older people are at higher risk, so take

 special care to visit homes of elderly people.
Continue to pay special attention to the marginalized,

 as is your routine practice.
Also as the people’s trusted health worker, try to

 reassure them that while those with
symptoms and high risk need close attention, for others, prevention measures will decrease
the risk of getting the disease.
