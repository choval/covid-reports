Title: Specimen Collection, Packaging and Transport
Guidelines for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
SOP number: ICMR-NIV/2019-nCoV/Specimens_01
Prepared by: Dr. Y.K. Gurav Date: 19/01/2020
Reviewed by: Dr. V. Potdar Date:20/01/2020
Approved by: Dr. P. Abraham Date:20/01/2020
Scope:
To be used by the Government health authorities/ hospitals/ clinicians/ laboratories planning to collect appropriate
clinical samples as indicated for diagnosis of 2019-nCoV.
Purpose:
This document describes the information for collection, packaging and transport of clinical specimens to Influenza
group at ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, Maharashtra for diagnosis of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-
nCoV)
Responsibilities:
• The clinician should decide necessity for collection of clinical specimens for laboratory testing of 2019-nCoV only after
following the case definition as given by the health authorities, Government ofIndia.
• Appropriate clinical sample need to be collected by laboratory personnel/ health care worker trained in specimen
collection in presence of a clinician.
• By following all biosafety precautions and using personal protective equipment (PPEs), clinical samples need to be
sent to the designated laboratory (ICMR-NIV, Pune) by following standard triple packaging.
Selection of patient:
Any person who presents with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) AND any one of the following i.e. a history of
travel from Wuhan, China in 14 days prior to symptoms onset; disease in healthcare worker working in an
environment of SARI patients; unusual or unexpected clinical course, especially sudden deterioration despite
appropriate treatment; should be urgently investigated. Updated case definition need to be followed as per MOHFW,
Govt of India which is available on the website www.mohfw.gov.in
Specimen collection details:
(Adapted from the WHO guidelines on 2019-nCoV):
*For transport of samples for viral detection, use VTM (viral transport medium) containing antifungal and antibiotic supplements. Avoid repeated
freezing and thawing of specimens.
Specimen labelling and processing:
• Personal protective equipment (apron, hand gloves, face shield, N95 Masks etc.) need to be used and all
biosafety precautions should be followed so as to protect individuals and theenvironment.
• Proper labelling (name/age/gender/specimen ID) need to be done on specimen container and other details of
sender (name/address/phone number) on the outer container by mentioning “To be tested for2019-nCoV”
• For any queries, the nodal officer from ICMR-NIV Pune (Dr Yogesh K.Gurav, Scientist E) may be contacted (Phone
020-26006290/ 26006390; Email: gurav.yk@gmail.com/gurav.yk@gov.in) and need to be informed in advance
before sending specimens to ICMR-NIV, Pune.

Requirements for Clinical Samples Collection, Packaging and Transport
1. Sample vials and Virus
Transport Medium (VTM)
2. Adsorbent material
(cotton, tissue paper),
paraffin, seizer, cello tape
3. A leak-proof secondary container (e.g.,
ziplock pouch, cryobox, 50 mL centrifuge
tube, plastic container)
4. Hard-frozen Gel Packs 5. A suitable outer container (e.g., thermocol box, ice-box, hard-board box)
(minimum dimensions: 10 x 10 x 10 cm)
Procedure for Specimen Packaging and Transport
1. Use PPE while handling
specimen
2. Seal the neck of the
sample vials using parafilm
3. Cover the sample vials
using absorbent material
4. Arrange primary
container (vial) in
secondary container
5. Placing the centrifuge tube
inside a zip-lock pouch
6. Placing the zip-lock pouch
inside a sturdy plastic
container and seal the neck
of the container
Note: Sample vials can
also be placed inside a
zip-lock pouch, covered
in absorbent material
and secured by heat-
sealing or rubber bands.
Then, the zip-lock pouch
should be placed inside
another plastic pouch
and secured
7. Using a thermocol box as
an outer container and
placing the secondary
container within it,
surrounded by hard-
frozen gel packs
7. Using a hard card-board box
as an outer container and
placing the secondary
container and the gel packs
8. Placing the completed
Specimen Referral Form
(available on www.niv.co.in)
and request letter inside a
leak-proof, zip-lock pouch
9. Securing the zip-lock
pouch with theSpecimen
Referral Form on the
outer container
10. Attaching the labels:
 Senders’ address, contact
number; Consignee’s
address /contactnumber;
 Biological substance-
Category B;
 ‘UN 3373’; Orientation
label, Handle with care
Documents to accompany:
1) Packaging list/proforma Invoice 2) Air way bill (for air transport) (to be prepared by sender or shipper) 3) Value
equivalence document (for road/rail/sea transport) [ Note: 1. A vaccine-carrier/ice-box can also be used as an outer
container 2. The minimum dimensions of the outer container should be 10 x 10 x 10 cm (length x width x height)]
