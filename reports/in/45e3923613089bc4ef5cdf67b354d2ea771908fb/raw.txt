Advisory on use of Homemade Protective Cover for
Face & Mouth
1. We are aware that social distancing and personal hygiene are
keys to prevent COVID 19 infections. Certain countries have
claimed benefits of homemade face cover for the general public.
Such homemade face cover is a good method for maintaining
personal hygiene. Such usage certainly will help in maintaining
overall hygienic health conditions.
2. Therefore, it is suggested that such people who are not suffering
from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use
the handmade reusable face cover, particularly when they step
out of their house. This will help in protecting the community at
large.
3. This face cover is not recommended for either health workers or
those working with or in contact with COVID 19 patients or are
patients themselves as these categories of people are required
to wear specified protective gear.
4. It is advised that two sets of such face covers be made so that
one can be washed while the other is used. Hand washing would
still remain essential criteria and hand should be washed before
wearing the face cover. Such face covers should also not be
thrown anywhere but kept safely, washed properly with soap and
hot water and dried properly before they are used.
5. These face covers could be made out of clean cloth available at
home, which needs to be thoroughly cleaned and washed before
a face cover is stitched/made. The face cover should be
prepared in such a manner that it can cover the mouth and nose
completely and can be tied over the face easily.

6. There must not be a sharing of face covers and a face cover
must be used by only one individual. So, in a family of several
members, each member should have a separate face cover.

Dated: 4th
April 2020
To
State Mission Director/CEO
State Rural Livelihoods Missions
Subject: Role of self-help groups in response to COVID-19 outbreak
Dear Madam/Sir,
It is heartening to learn that State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLMs) are taking various
initiatives for addressing the COVID-19 outbreak related issues. The sensitivity and
responsiveness demonstrated by Self-Help Group members in addressing various needs
emerged due to the current situation at the community level is highly appreciable. In
continuation of the earlier advisory dated 26.03.2020 (copy attached for ready reference),
issued by this Ministry, I would like to reiterate/suggest the following for your information
and necessary action
1. Self-Help Group network in the States provides an institutional structure to deliver and
reiterate the right messages in the community to encourage adoption of practices
recommended by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) with regard to
response and containment of COVID-19. In this context, it is advised that SRLMs should
augment their efforts for creating awareness amongst members and community on
critical issues including social distancing, use of masks, recommended practices,
quarantine and psycho-social issues of migrants, care of elderly population, mental
health and wellbeing etc.
2. Also, SRLMs may coordinate with Department of Health and local authorities and
enhance efforts on production of masks, sanitizers, protective gears like gowns etc to
meet the demand from health department and. An advisory from Secretary, Rural
Development (Copy attached) has also been sent to Chief Secretaries of all the States
and UTs for supporting production of masks etc through RSETI trained candidates and
using the RSETI infrastructure for producing them. Advisories on easy methods of
making of masks and right way of using masks and on Ayurvedic immunity boosting
measures respectively, issued by M/o HFW and M/o AYUSH, are attached with the letter
for ready reference. So far about 132 Lakh masks have been produced by various SHGs
across the country, having established the capacity for such large scale productions, the
same may be ramped up. The SRLMs may contact the state health Departments and
District Officials to augment the supplies.
3. Aarogya Setu is a mobile application developed by the Government of India to connect
essential health services with the people of India in our combined fight against COVID-
19. The Application is aimed at augmenting the initiatives of the Government of India,
particularly the Department of Health, in proactively reaching out to and informing the
users regarding risks, best practices and relevant advisories pertaining to the
containment of COVID-19. The application is available in 11 languages and operates
both on Android and IOS mobile. All the SRLMs are requested to promote use of
Aarogya Setu Application developed by MoHFW for staying informed and alert against
COVID-19 (https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/). Self-Help Group members shall
also be encouraged to download this App to stay informed and updated.
4. For technical inputs and updates, it recommended to refer MoFHW website regularly
(https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). Websites of MoAYUSH (http://ayush.gov.in/), MoWCD
(https://wcd.nic.in/), FSSAI (https://www.fssai.gov.in/) and Ministry of Consumer
Affairs (https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/) shall also be referred from time to time.
5. We have been informed that in most states, SHGs/VOs/CLFs have also initiated work
related to provision of ration or cooked food to poor and vulnerable families using the
Vulnerability Reduction Fund or with support from State and district administration.
We encourage such activities so as to ensure that no family is left hungry in these
difficult times. SRLMs may like universalise such interventions through convergence
with relevant departments, like Food and Civil Supplies, for providing rations to the
needy families through the women’s institutions.
6. It is again cautioned that SRLMs must ensure that members follow various advisories
including social distancing issued by MoHFW and State Governments while undertaking
any activity. A pocket reference book on COVID-19 including precautions and safety
measures to be followed has been issued by MoHFW and is also attached with the letter
for reference and circulation.

It’s nearly 1 pm and the municipality community hall in Kakkanad
neighbourhood of Kochi is a hive of activity. Inside the compound, a
wooden desk blocks the passage to the hall. A wash basin, complete
with handwash, sits on the le t. Beyond the wooden table, on which
Powering this kitchen and scores of others across the state is the ever-dependable army of Kudumbashree
a hand sanitiser sits forlorn, around eight women, all in white
aprons and matching white tennis caps with cloth masks covering
half their faces, are working furiously.
The menu today is simple: ney-choru (ghee rice) and chicken curry.
The cooking’s done. One set of women are engaged in ﬁlling little
plastic pouches with the chicken curry, while the others are tending
to the rice. As soon as they are ready, a couple of men hurry over
and bring them to the table at the entrance from where they are
scooped into little bags by volunteers and delivered to homes
nearby.
At a time when Kerala and the rest of the country are under severe
lockdown as part of measures to tackle , the little
morsels of food that get sent out from this makeshi t community
kitchen in Thrikkakara municipality are central to the hunger-free
project of the state’s Le t government. And powering this kitchen
and scores of others across the state is the ever-dependable army of
Kudumbashree, a powerful self-help network of 43 lakh women.

On Wednesday, when chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan spoke of
opening community kitchens to feed migrant workers and destitute
families, the councillors of Thrikkakara municipality didn’t have to
think hard on whom to rely for support. They simply dialled the
grassroot-level neighbourhood units of Kudumbashree who
immediately jumped on board. Within no time, the kitchen was
opened Friday morning to serve breakfast.

formed in 1997 as a three-tier community network aimed at

“These are women who run exceptional catering services. Soon,
they will handle it entirely,” said Nazar, an independent councillor
who helped set up the kitchen.
Kudumbashree, meaning ‘prosperity of family’ in Malayalam, was
formed in 1997 as a three-tier community network aimed at
empowering women in each family and making them drivers of
change at the grassroot level.

Over the years, their success, due in large part to their enterprising
abilities and hunger to volunteer, have challenged male hierarchies
in a deeply-patriarchal state. From driving taxis to running Metro
ticket counters, operating paper mills to orphanages and day-care
centres, they have done it all. And so when each government faces
an arduous task such as the present one, they have happily relied
upon Kudumbashree.
“Kudumbashree’s success was that it was able to discover these
women who want to function as public servants. More than
improving wages, they have shown an inclination to volunteer and
do something for the society,” said Manjeesh, a district programme
manager with the network.

Back at the community kitchen, as the last of the food packets get
bundled up, the Kudumbashree cooks in white aprons with the
ubiquitous logo of three ﬂowers on their pocket sleeves have a bit of
time to rest. And then they have to start prepping for dinner: a
simple meal of rice and sambar which has to get delivered at
doorsteps by 8 pm.
“We distributed 380 packets of chapathi and vegetable curry in the
morning. Lunch and dinner are for 500 people. Tomorrow, we are
expecting to cook food for nearly a 1000 people, a majority of which
would go to migrant workers” said Nazar.
The process to identify beneﬁciaries for the community meals
across Kerala is pretty straight-forward: the local panchayat ward
members/councillors, ASHA workers and anganwadi teachers comb
through every home in their jurisdiction, making a list of those who
need food.
They add a few dozens, keeping in mind the destitute and homeless.
A helpline number is also provided on which people could call and
enquire about the service. The state government has already started
assigning volunteers, mostly young people who have private
vehicles, who can transport supplies and cooked meals.

Nazar adds that he’s been getting dozens of calls from youngsters
wanting to volunteer. “But because the government has instructed
that all safety protocols have to be followed at community kitchens,
we’re careful. Look at me, even I’m standing outside. The staﬀ inside
can go out only a ter they complete the shi t.”
Riyaz, a computer technician, is among those who have signed up
for the volunteering programme. He waits in front of the wooden
desk at the entrance for his share of food packets to be delivered in
his neighbourhood. He works at home for a few hours and then
engages in volunteering services like these.

When asked if such welfare programmes could turn out to be a
burden for the government, he replied, “There’s no burden at all.
There are so many young people like us waiting to see how we can
support the government. All that we spend is on fuel, which is
practically nothing.”
There’s optimism inside the kitchen too. Nisha, one of the
Kudumbashree cooks who runs a catering agency called ‘Nirbhaya’
in her neighbourhood, is not wilting under pressure just yet. She
understands the demand for cooked food will go up in the next
couple of weeks, but she’s unfettered.
“During the ﬂoods, we helped cook for 2000 people. So this is
nothing,” she said, with a smile.

as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19
infected person. This can happen in two ways:
Direct close contact:

 one can get the infection
by being in close contact with COVID-19
patients (within one Metre of the infected
person), especially if they do not cover their
face when coughing or sneezing.
Indirect contact:

 the droplets survive on
surfaces and clothes for many days. Therefore,
touching any such infected surface or cloth
and then touching one’s mouth, nose or eyes
can transmit the disease.
The incubation period of COVID 19 (time between


getting the infection and showing symptoms) is
1 to 14 days
Some people with the infection, but without any


serious symptoms can also spread the disease.
As a key member of the primary health care team, we want you and your family to
be safe. Following the advice in this document will help you in staying safe.
As you know a new respiratory disease called COVID-19 is spreading across the world. India has
also reported cases from states and the government is trying to contain the spread of the disease.
As an important frontline worker, you play a major role in preventing its spread.
Your Role as a Frontline Worker is two-fold:
1. Spread key messages in the community about measures to prevent the infection.
2. Take actions for early detection and referral of suspected COVID-19 cases.

How to take care of yourself and carry on with your duties as a frontline worker?
Take all preventive measures

 that you are talking about in the community such as keeping safe
distance, washing hands frequently including before and after home visits. Carry your own soap
if necessary
If you are visiting or

 accompanying a suspected case to any health facility, make sure to cover
both your mouth and nose with folded cloth or mask.
If you are conducting community meetings or supporting outreach sessions the

 groups should
not be larger than 10-12 people.
Maintaining safe distances for those living in crowded areas or the homeless is going to be difficult.


Even then you should inform them about preventive measures and support them as required.
Self-monitor

 for signs of illness and report to the Medical Officer, immediately if any symptoms
develop.
Ensure that you continue to undertake tasks

 related to care of pregnant women,
newborns and sick children, Post Natal Care, Breastfeeding and Nutritional Counselling, TB
and NCD patient follow up while taking preventive measures.
Remember older people are at higher risk, so take

 special care to visit homes of elderly people.
Continue to pay special attention to the marginalized,

 as is your routine practice.
Also as the people’s trusted health worker, try to

 reassure them that while those with
symptoms and high risk need close attention, for others, prevention measures will decrease
the risk of getting the disease.

In the wake of the Covid 19 outbreak, entire mankind across the globe is suffering. Enhancing
the body’s natural defence system (Immunity) plays an important role in maintaining optimum
health.
We all know that prevention is better than cure. While there is no medicine for COVID-19 as of
now, it will be good to take preventive measures which boost our immunity in these times.
Ayurveda, being the science of life, propagates the gifts of nature in maintaining healthy
and happy living. Ayurveda’s extensive knowledge base on preventive care, derives from the
concepts of “Dinacharya” - daily regimes and “Ritucharya” - Seasonal regimes to maintain
healthy life. It is a totally plant-based science. The simplicity of awareness about oneself and
the harmony each individual can achieve by uplifting and maintaining his or her immunity is
emphasized across Ayurveda’s classical scriptures.
