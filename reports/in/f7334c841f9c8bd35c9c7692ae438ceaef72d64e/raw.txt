installation sites might not have central Oxygen Lines.
2. The machine should have Invasive, non-invasive and CPAP features to
make them versatile.
3. 200-600 ML tidal volume, Lung Mechanics Display
4. Monitoring of Plateau Pressure, PEEP, PS, oxygen concentration, lung
mechanics/inverse ratio (I:E)
5. Pressure & volume control & PSV
6. Continuous working capability for 4-5 days”
