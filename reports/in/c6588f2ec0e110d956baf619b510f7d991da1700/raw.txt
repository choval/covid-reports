Additional Travel Advisory (II) for COVID-19 for Indians intending to travel abroad
More than 100 countries across the world now have reported cases of COVID-
19. People traveling to these countries or people who have travelled abroad might
come in contact with people affected with COVID-19 during their stay or even
while in transit at the airports. Within these countries, few countries have reported
very large number of cases and deaths putting passengers from these countries
particularly at higher risk of infection.
In view of the above, Indian citizens are advised:
i. To avoid non- essential travel abroad.
ii. They are further strongly advised to refrain from travelling to China, Italy,
Iran, Republic of Korea, Japan, France, Spain and Germany.
