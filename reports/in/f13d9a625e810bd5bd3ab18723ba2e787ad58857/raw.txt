Dear
I am to request that there is a need to promote digital learning so that the students
can continue their learning by making full use of the available Digital / e-Learning Platforms
during the period the educational institutions are closed as a precautionary measure to
fight COVID-19. A list of key Digital / e-Learning Platforms which are provided by MHRD
for online education is as under:
