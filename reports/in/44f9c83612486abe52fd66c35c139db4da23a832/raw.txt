Dear Admiral Devendra Joshi Ji,
At the outset, I would like to appreciate the hard work being done by your
team under your able leadership in effective management of COVID-19.
2. You would agree that availability of blood in the blood banks, both public and
private, for addressing various exigencies and emergencies is essential. We are
also cognizant of the situation that due to restrictions, it may not be possible to
organize blood donation camps. However, at the same time, it is necessary to
ensure sufficient availability of blood, especially for people needing regular blood
transfusion on account of blood disorders such as Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Anemia
and Hemophilia etc.
3. Keeping in view the present peculiar situation due to COVID-19, I shall be
grateful if the following measures, inter alia, are taken to ensure adequate
availability of blood in the blood banks, namely: -
(a) Appeal for Blood donation from Hon'ble Chief Minister and yourself may be
published in local dailies and telecast and broadcast in local media channels.
(b) Use of e-Raktkosh portal as a single point for maintaining records of donors as
well as providing real-time information on status of current stocks of each
blood group may be encouraged. The prospective blood donors may be asked
to register on the portal. Blood Banks in your state may also be directed to
update blood availability in the e-Raktkosh portal regularly.

Dear Shri Biplab Deb Ji,
At the outset, I would like to appreciate the hard work being done by your
team under your able leadership in effective management of COVID-19.
2. You would agree that availability of blood in the blood banks, both public and
private, for addressing various exigencies and emergencies is essential. We are
also cognizant of the situation that due to restrictions, it may not be possible to
organize blood donation camps. However, at the same time, it is necessary to
ensure sufficient availability of blood, especially for people needing regular blood
transfusion on account of blood disorders such as Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Anemia
and Hemophilia etc.
3. Keeping in view the present peculiar situation due to COVID-19, I shall be
grateful if the following measures, inter alia, are taken to ensure adequate
availability of blood in the blood banks, namely: -
(a) Appeal for Blood donation from Hon'ble Chief Minister and yourself may be
published in local dailies and telecast and broadcast in local media channels.
(b) Use of e-Raktkosh portal as a single point for maintaining records of donors as
well as providing real-time information on status of current stocks of each
blood group may be encouraged. The prospective blood donors may be asked
to register on the portal. Blood Banks in your state may also be directed to
update blood availability in the e-Raktkosh portal regularly.

Dear Shri R. K. Mathur Ji,
At the outset, I would like to appreciate the hard work being done by your
team under your able leadership in effective management of COVID-19.
2. You would agree that availability of blood in the blood banks, both public and
private, for addressing various exigencies and emergencies is essential. We are
also cognizant of the situation that due to restrictions, it may not be possible to
organize blood donation camps. However, at the same time, it is necessary to
ensure sufficient availability of blood, especially for people needing regular blood
transfusion on account of blood disorders such as Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Anemia
and Hemophilia etc.
3. Keeping in view the present peculiar situation due to COVID-19, I shall be
grateful if the following measures, inter alia, are taken to ensure adequate
availability of blood in the blood banks, namely: -
(a) Appeal for Blood donation from Hon'ble Chief Minister and yourself may be
published in local dailies and telecast and broadcast in local media channels.
(b) Use of e-Raktkosh portal as a single point for maintaining records of donors as
well as providing real-time information on status of current stocks of each
blood group may be encouraged. The prospective blood donors may be asked
to register on the portal. Blood Banks in your state may also be directed to
update blood availability in the e-Raktkosh portal regularly.

Dear Thiru. Malladi Rao Ji,
At the outset, I would like to appreciate the hard work being done by your
team under your able leadership in effective management of COVID-19.
2. You would agree that availability of blood in the blood banks, both public and
private, for addressing various exigencies and emergencies is essential. We are
also cognizant of the situation that due to restrictions, it may not be possible to
organize blood donation camps. However, at the same time, it is necessary to
ensure sufficient availability of blood, especially for people needing regular blood
transfusion on account of blood disorders such as Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Anemia
and Hemophilia etc.
3. Keeping in view the present peculiar situation due to COVID-19, I shall be
grateful if the following measures, inter alia, are taken to ensure adequate
availability of blood in the blood banks, namely: -
(a) Appeal for Blood donation from Hon'ble Chief Minister and yourself may be
published in local dailies and telecast and broadcast in local media channels.
(b) Use of e-Raktkosh portal as a single point for maintaining records of donors as
well as providing real-time information on status of current stocks of each
blood group may be encouraged. The prospective blood donors may be asked
to register on the portal. Blood Banks in your state may also be directed to
update blood availability in the e-Raktkosh portal regularly.
