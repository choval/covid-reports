As you all are aware that the covlD-l9 panclemic is throwing up unique challenges
for our health systems' It is also leacling to particular challenges of not only ensuring the
adequate supply of oxygen but also protocols related with handling the rnajor sources of
supplies.
I(eeping above facts in mincl, gr-ridelines have been prepared by incorporating the
major sources for supply of oxygen, oxygen system component, normative requirement of
quantity of oxygen ancl precautions required for handling the oxygen cylincler inclucling
disinfecting cylinders right from filling point to transportation, loading, unloading, use,
exchange, cariage in the hospitals ancl in critical care facilities. All concerned hospitals and
:lltt
*"'. be infonnecl to ensure timely requisitions ancl payrnents so that there is no
olsrlrprton rn oxygen supplies.
I am enclosing the control rooul erlergency contact numbers of Al1 Inclia Indr"rstrial
Gases Manufactuters' Association and States / UTs can contact this control room clirectly in
case of,any difficulty or clarification.
I am srtre that State/UT Govemment will fincl this brief and relevant guicleline ,seflil
and disserninate this to all the health facilities handling covlD_19 patients.

Corona virus pandemic has presented such challenges to the norms of medical care in the world that
responding and countering this challenge will demand a major functional and behavioral change to our
working environment'This note intends to present a method of supplying oxygen to medical facilities
and individual patients in the current environment.
l. Major Source for Supply of Oxygen
oxygen to medical facilities is supplied and fed through four primary methods:
Generate and Supply
Oxygen Cylinders Liquid Oxygen
+
Oxygen Concentrators
---1
Oxygen Generators
1' oxygen cylinders - These are primarily used in hospitals where Medical Gas pipeline (MGps) has not
been laid, however many hospitals use cylinders connected in series to supply oxygen to the wards
through a manifold. The Jumbo cylinders are used in critical areas like operation Theatres, lCUs, HDUs,
etc' Smaller cylinders (B Type) are used for stretchers, ambulances, general wards, etc. The use of
oxygen cylindersrequires three times the inventory of cylindersconsumed in a hospital in a day (one
setof cylinders in use, one set as backup and one set in refilling station). lt is labour intensive,
logisticallychallenging, unsafe, unhygienic (chances of carrying infection from hospital) and expensive
method' However this is the most easily adaptable method in short term and emergency situations.
2' Liquid Medical oxygen (tMo) - This demands a MGPS, a safe, open, unhindered space upto 9M
x1'5M in a hospital premise. lt also demands installation of a storage tank which needs a pESo license
and a third party supply dependence. lt also demands one day of oxygen supply through cylinders as a
backup' But this is a far better, cheaper, safer method than supply through cylinders, however this is
again a supplier dependent method.
3' oxygen concentrators - An oxygen concentrator is a self-contained, electrically powered medical
device designed to concentrate oxygen from ambient air. This is used on the bedside without MGpS and
caters to 1'-2 patients at a time. This oxygen cannot be used with ventilator, because the pressure
generated is very low.
4' oxygen Generators (Plant)-This demands a MGPS and an assured cylinder backup. lt allows
ownership of oxygen with the user with no third party dependence. lt is safe, efficient, cheapest, least
polluting, non human dependent for operations and most contemporary form of oxygen supply.
