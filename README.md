# Worldwide reports of Coronavirus (COVID-19)

Many countries are issuing daily situation reports regarding the Coronavirus Pandemic.  
This repository puts them all together for two purposes: archive & centralized resource.

For more information regarding the Coronavirus:

## Notes

* This repository is a WIP for a list of automatically updated collection of reports.
* If any country (with situation reports) doesn't get updated or is missing, please submit an issue.
* Some countries have a PDF generated from HTML pages.
* Some files are not situation reports, but related to the disease.
* Reports are saved by country using their ISO-3166 2 letters alpha code.
* I'm aware of files with wrong dates, there's a date overwrite file in the reports folders.
* The crawler User-Agent is `CovidReports`.
* If any site needs this crawler to stop, please change the `robots.txt` accordingly (I will still continue getting the reports manually if I can).
